Pretty simple, right?   Well, we like to think we're using these essays as a starting point for conversations that end up going in strange and surprising directions. Nothing makes us happier than dragging luminaries like Mencken, Orwell, Adorno, and Didion into our own long-standing obsessions with conspiracy theories, the National Security State, media consolidation, high and low culture, and the meaning and purpose of religion.   But this isn't a seminar, and we're not scholars or experts. Joe is a comic, Josh is a writer, and for them, this is just fun. So if you love to read but feel like you don't do enough of it, and you think you might enjoy hearing two ordinary guys shoot the s*** about things other than sports, politics, or pop culture, this is the podcast for you.   Each episode, we choose a reading that's publicly available and encourage all our listeners to read it beforehand so you can follow along with our conversation.

There are so many sticky, complex challenges we face in the world today that can fundamentally be solved through the exponential advances happening in technology. This podcast is about sharing some of this incredible information with you, to take note and use in your own life, to take advantage of all the endless opportunities that are out there for you to embrace.<br />
<br />
My name is Lizzie Mettam and I created this podcast to help drive conversation and action around how we can all work together towards solving some of these big issues. Whether it's what kind of work is opening up for us in our future economy, new education models to consider and trial, brilliant initiatives that help tackle social issues like homelessness, inequity, obesity and the massive rise in mental health problems..... even help with how to parent our children and teenagers in the digital age, this podcast is for you. <br />
<br />
I believe dogs are drawn to the kindness in people and they innately seem to know who of us out there is kind and compassionate. So I'm learning with Cha Cha, my gorgeous retriever who doesn't retrieve, to filter my guests and ideas, for a more compassionate future, a thoughtful future...... and together I'm hoping we can drive a positive conversation around the endless possibilities the future holds for all of us. So grab a chair, a stick and some marshmallows and enjoy the conversation.<br />

Tune into this fascinating show - every Wednesday from 10 am pacific time - as Janet Richmond leads listeners through an hour or two of rich, tantalizing, 5th dimensional, raw spiritual information direct from the Higher Selves!  2015 brings a shift to the show where Janet opens up the forum to share much more of the Higher Self information.  The breadth of the material is vast and Janet will offer many different perspectives sometimes delving into what may normally be seen as unknown.  Janet accepts on air (or via email) requests for healing, general questions or ideas of what topics would interest the listeners.  This is an amazing opportunity to call in and receive personal one-on-one help to help unclog areas of your life and/or to better understand your journey.  You even will get answers for what you had thought were unanswerable questions.  And as always, even listening to a healing for someone else will take you through the same transformative experience as the person it's directed toward. 
Since 2006, Janet Richmond has made it her life's effort to promote the Higher Self healing techniques to empower those who learn it so that they can start living the life they want and deserve. Janet offers many ways to begin utilizing the Neutralizing technique; from her book CHOICES - Neutralizing Your Negative Thoughts and Emotional Blueprints, to her radio show on Blog Talk radio, Private sessions, Meetups and Catalytic Art. Janet is also finishing up her second book 'Soul Psychology' and will be hosting online workshops in the near future.

Computer systems up until the turn of the century became constantly faster without any particular effort simply because the hardware they were running on increased its clock speed with every new release. This trend has changed and today's CPUs stall at around 3 GHz. The size of modern computer systems in terms of contained transistors (cores in CPUs/GPUs, CPUs/GPUs in compute nodes, compute nodes in clusters), however, still increases constantly. This caused a paradigm shift in writing software: instead of optimizing code for a single thread, applications now need to solve their given tasks in parallel in order to expect noticeable performance gains. Distributed computing, i.e., the distribution of work on (potentially) physically isolated compute nodes is the most extreme method of parallelization.

Big Data Analytics is a multi-million dollar market that grows constantly! Data and the ability to control and use it is the most valuable ability of today's computer systems. Because data volumes grow so rapidly and with them the complexity of questions they should answer, data analytics, i.e., the ability of extracting any kind of information from the data becomes increasingly difficult. As data analytics systems cannot hope for their hardware getting any faster to cope with performance problems, they need to embrace new software trends that let their performance scale with the still increasing number of processing elements.

In this lecture, we take a look a various technologies involved in building distributed, data-intensive systems. We discuss theoretical concepts (data models, encoding, replication, ...) as well as some of their practical implementations (Akka, MapReduce, Spark, ...). Since workload distribution is a concept which is useful for many applications, we focus in particular on data analytics.",English,Technology,https://www.tele-task.de/series/1179/,tele-TASK,1306729033

Yoga meaning 'Union of you and your Higher Self'. ET Yoga is actually a new Yoga--the Yoga of Belief. Extra-terrestrial and Yogic information complement each other and thus the marriage of the two. Specifically the ET information is mostly about the concept that 'Thought Creates', 'Belief is Everything' and these concepts help us to become more self empowered. The bulk of the Yoga information comes from Sri. Ramana Maharshi, Sri Swami Satchidananda, Baba Ram Dass, Paramahansa Yogananda and Mooji. The ET information is primarily from Andromedan, Sirian, Pleiadian, Arcturian, and Essassani sources. It turns out that the more you learn about the way the universe works (The Ultimate Truths of Reality) the more you know about the human body; so the concepts cross connect. Thus ET Yoga also reflects the concepts that create excellent health, the ability to maintain it and to fix issues as they arise without the need for mainstream medical. Specific meditations, concepts and techniques related to a spiritual journey are also detailed on ET Yoga. The concepts that ""If you believe it, it is"" and ""The whole world is your teacher"" are guiding principles supporting the concept that it is your thoughts, definitions, emotions and intentions that create your experience in this dimension. You cannot experience what you are not the vibration of. The website at etyoga.com was designed as a one stop shop for those seeking perfect health and an outline for a spiritual path. The E-books there also connect to about 250 pages on the internet to save the seeker's time. The site is called 'Healing the Known and Unknown'.

""I copied every one of your ET Yoga programs since I listen to them multiple times each week and I have labelled them by the important topics you covered. From my perspective, ET Yoga was one of the most important programs on the net for attaining enlightenment, truth and true knowledge. Thanks you for the months of powerful information delivered with love and sincerity."" John Boston U.S.A.

""ET Yoga continues to be a source of amazing information. I love your show and I always learn many new things""  Sharon U.S.A.

""I am an avid listener to Dr. Fred Bell and I discovered your program by hapinstance or by fate or divine intervention. I enjoyed what you have to say about health immunity, dna and longevity. You and Dr. Bell are on the same page so to speak."" Alex Parkridge, Ill.

'ET Yoga is intelligent, thought provoking and consciousness uplifting. Charles weaved a variety of topics masterfully in a concise understandable conversational format that will uplift your life and allow more light to reflect on the planet."" Drew Connecticut

""I want to thank you for your radio show, since listening, I have embraced a remembering that seems to pull the hologram together in 3D. I've read 'Cosmic Voyage' by Courtney Brown, have purchased,  and using Egyptian Healing Rods, beginning to read Patricia Cori's 'Sirian Revelations', watched Bashar's ""Crystal Light Show' and series on You-tube, so much I've learned. And other synchronistic occurrences, you mentioned David Hudson, I own the 3 DVDS, plus, I have ordered and used 'White Powder Gold' from Acension Alchemy, And most recently, you gave a website www. universe-people.com which ties to my recent affiliation with the Ashtar Galactic Command where I found the downloaded 'Bringers of the Dawn'. Thanks Paul Dayton Ohio

My intention is to interview stylists, barbers and other beauty members and discuss topics that affects everyone on a daily basis.

The industry cannot continue unless we bring certain subject matter to life and let people express themselves freely. There is only so much of that can be done in the work place. There needs to be a level of intimacy that has been buried for quite some time now.

Follow me as i journey across the nation to openly discuss any topic and for the chance to get to know stylist or Barber better.

There are websites. Hardly anyone visits them.

There is Instagram. But, that's framed in a way where people can control how they want to be seen.

Then there's the Scissor Me Now podcast. Voluntary, truly candid interviews where people tell all.

Without telling our stories, we will be buried and I will not let that happen.
