48,847,VFTPB 13: Saying Goodbye to Hockey (Why Cam Retired),http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/364657481-user-766735551-vftpb-13-saying-goodbye-to-hockey-why-cam-retired.mp3,2119,"Cam Connor discusses why he ended his hockey career and the injuries surrounding that decision, which included a broken back.

Questions and topics include:
-Why did it take two years for Cam's broken back to be diagnosed by team doctors?
-What happens when a player retires?
-What, if any, player reached out to him once he left the game.
-The transition from professional hockey to the 'real world' and the lack of services and support for players making that transition back then.
-Why can't some players make the transition away from hockey?
-What was it like that last time he met Gordie Howe (when Howe was 82 years old)?
-Cam discusses Kris Russell accidentally scoring in his own team's net and if that ever happened before to a teammate on his team?
-A quick check-in to see how Cam's prediction that the Las Vegas Golden Knights will make the playoffs is faring.
-Another missed opportunity, Cam talks about the time he was asked (in 1981) to invest in this new product called...rollerblades/inline skates and he turned it down.
-Some stories of his public speaking events, including when he got locked inside a maximum security prison for hours to speak with 12 men convicted of murder!

<h1 class=""text-align-center"">NEW Episodes every Monday at 9:00am</h1><h3>The normalization of mass shootings is perhaps the most horrifying aspect of modern American life - which is saying something. In this episode, Joe &amp; Josh delve into the minds of of the men and boys who commit such crimes, with the help of Andrew O'Hagan's masterful synthesis of their self-serious, self-pitying manifestos, ""Who's the Alpha Male Now, Bitches?"" O'Hagan manages an admirable literary analysis of these beta male killers and their violent alpha fantasies without either glamorizing or dehumanizing the miserable bastards. Writing in 2015, O'Hagan refuses to harp on the usual suspects of violent media or American gun culture, seeking instead the common denominators in the killers' inner lives and examining cases outside the U.S. that got less attention in the American press. This episode was recorded well before the tragedies in Las Vegas or Sutherland Springs, but sadly, O'Hagan's essay only seems more spot-on now.

73,905,"SMN EP 08 MEGAN NICOLS ST. LOUIS, MO",http://podsync.net/download/ovJR/wTzAO4g3Fvk.mp4,3864,"Megan Nichols is an American Barber and owner of Union Barbershop in St. Louis, MO.

A girl from California, Megan left her beloved West coast to end up in the Midwest. It wasn't the easiest move to say the least. But for Megan there's no such thing as excuses.

For the first couple months she would get up power down some Jameson, go to the grocery store hand out cards and tell people that she can fix their necklines, fix their haircuts or do a sick shave. Soon after she managed to build an entire clientele booked two weeks out solid. Now she owns her own trained staff, all booked 2 weeks out solid. The number one complaint you'll ever see on the internet about Megan shop is that they can't get a cut NOW because everyone is booked. Plan ahead dude.

Get off of your ass go outside and create the hurricane that is your good life (And have while you're doing it, or else what's the fuckin point).<img src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scissormenow/~4/nudWhAXo2uo"" height=""1"" width=""1"" alt=""""/>",2017-12-05 05:44:44+00

<p>A Snobs-vs-Parvenus Comedy Written and Directed by Keith Suta!</p>
<p>Foxglove Greens is Great Britain's most-exclusive golf course, having only one member, and serving primarly as a refuge for wild foxes and eccentrics like Lady Wethered.  But when ruthless American real estate developer Fred McLeod comes to buy the entire village of Alderburgh, he finds himself engaged in a high-stakes game for the future of the course against a plucky university dropout, a constantly drunk Admiral, and his own son!  It's the snobs versus the other snobs in this racous comedy with just a little bit of golf in it!</p>
<p>Featuring:  Leyla Kirschner as Rosalind Benjamin;  Bennett Drozic as Craig McLeod and the Scientist; Kari Doll as Ella Theodore and Hippolata Crinklesburg; Sarah Suta as Lady Wethered and Tansy; Richard Dunbar as Fred McLeod and Mr. Hogan; and Keith Suta as the Admiral and Hubert!  Live Sound Effects performed by Kyle Suta and Liam Meyer!  Original music composed and performed by Garrett Robinson!</p>
<p>Recorded live at Bozeman, Montana's Verge Theater on June 11, 2016!  What you hear is what the audience heard with no overdubs and minimal post-production on volume to try to make it comfortable to your ears! All sound effects were analog and executed live by our fantastic performers!</p>",2017-12-08 00:30:30+00

I learned a lot, laughed a lot, moved a lot, and grew A LOT. Today I'm sharing 10 things I learned throughout what I'd call one of the toughest years I have had to date professionally. So many great things happened, but a lot of really big changes came with the growth too I wasn't quite ready for in so many words so I'm hoping my ten things can inspire you to have a conversation with yourself about what you learned this year too and what you're going to take into next year. We, as a team, are sharing our ten things so it's been really fun to hear where everyone's been and is headed as we dive (read run like hell) into 2018. </p> Thank you as always for keeping up with me on this platform and please leave your comments on iTunes about what you think about our podcast! I read every single comment here so please please take a moment to let me know what you think.   I hope everyone has a relaxing holiday season filled with all the things they love! Keep being kind to one another and definitely keep partying.    See you in 2018 here!   Jordan",2017-12-13 19:30:23+00

As 2017 comes to an end, Dr. Rob Zatechka and Travis Justice give their final thoughts on what has been a remarkable year.<br />
This addition of the Husker Doc Talk Podcast presented by the <a href=""http://www.rimingtontrophy.com"">Rimington Trophy</a> was recorded on location at the <a href=""http://www.infusionbrewing.com"">Infusion Brewing Company</a> in Benson. Yes, lots of beer was consumed! Yes, Dr. Rob and Travis got into their now weekly Brook Berringer argument. And yes they spend a lot of time talking about Scott Frost, recruiting, and the upcoming bowl game that Frost will coach for UCF.<br />
Some special guests join the show. Scott from <a href=""http://www.huskerhounds.com"">Husker Hounds</a> and Jessica from <a href=""http://www.ticketexpress.com"">Ticket Express</a> both discuss who Scott Frost is good for business and how the entire climate surrounding Husker football has turned from cold to burning hot!<br />
Infusion Brewing has supplied beer for Dr. Rob and Travis all season long. Hear from what of their talented brewers on what makes Infusion so good and what to expect in 2018.<br />
This season has been the most listened to for the Husker Doc Talk Podcast presented by the Rimington Trophy; thank you for making it happen! To keep up with Dr. Rob while he's not in surgery or podcasting, following him on Twitter, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/doctalksports"">@doctalksports</a>.<br />
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! We will be back in 2018 with more drinking and more Husker football talk!<br />",2017-12-19 15:25:05+00

Ask anyone in hair or service, it is the intense repetition of movements that cause severe physical damage over time. What amplifies this  damage in the beauty industry is the chemicals along side it. With health insurance rarely offered, what is a career stylist supposed to do?

<p><strong>Hey, John Davies here trying to shed a little light on a tricky subject.</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking that a vocal coach is a singing teacher, right? Well, it isn&#8217;t quite that simple. The term has a very specific meaning in classical singing. So you need to be a bit careful what you&#8217;re searching for on Google.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m looking for a <em>&#8216;vocal coach Los Angeles&#8217;</em>. The fact is that I&#8217;m not looking for a singing teacher. Let me explain. Let&#8217;s say that I have to perform an operatic role or a large role in something like Handel&#8217;s Messiah or the Verdi Requiem. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve performed these often and even recorded them. But I still need a vocal coach. And the vocal coach is usually the rehearsal pianist in a major opera company or a symphony society. Here&#8217;s what happens.</p>
<h2>What does a Vocal Coach Do?</h2>
<p>I get the role and the conductor has already decided how he wants the work to sound. That&#8217;s what conductors do. They don&#8217;t just keep time. They play a symphony orchestra and they interpret music of the symphony in the same way as a guitarist interprets a song. </p>
<p>When you play a song on your guitar, you put your own spin on it, or you have a specific way that you think the song should sound. Well, that&#8217;s what opera and symphony conductors do. They decide how they want their performance of the Verdi Requiem to sound.</p>
<p>They then have multiple sessions with the company rehearsal pianist so that the pianist can play the work exactly how the conductor wants it. And THEN, the pianist get busy coaching the soloists so that they can perform their part exactly how the conductor wants to hear it. And that process is called vocal coaching. </p>
<h2> &#8220;It&#8217;ll be Alright on the Night&#8221;</h2>
<p>Even though I&#8217;ve done multiple seasons of the Requiem, and have recorded it with a fabulous cast of world renowned singers, what then? The company still requires me to put in many hours with the vocal coach. That number, by the way, will often be greater than eighty hours! </p>
<p>Yes, believe it! We don&#8217;t just walk out and say &#8220;It&#8217;ll be alright on the night.&#8221; Trust me, if you don&#8217;t prepare for very long hours, it definitely will NOT be alright on the night.</p>
<h2>Googling &#8216;Vocal Coach Los Angeles&#8217;</h2>
<p>So when you&#8217;re looking for a vocal coach Los Angeles, you&#8217;re probably not looking for what I just described. It&#8217;s more likely that you&#8217;re looking for someone to train your voice so you can sing really well. How do you go about that?</p>
<p>You might think that looking at a site like the National Association of Teachers of singing might be a good place to start. A national association normally seems to have a certain credibility&#8230;because it&#8217;s called NATIONAL. </p>
<p>Well, anywhere else, that&#8217;s quite likely, because if you&#8217;re a NATIONAL thing, it means that you have been approved by the government and you&#8217;re somehow official. Like I said&#8230;that&#8217;s anywhere else. What about America?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not the case. There&#8217;s no law stopping people from setting up a national association, and in America, a national association basically creates a membership network which reaches beyond cities, counties and states. It&#8217;s a nationwide thing, and members pay to belong&#8230;provided they meet certain requirements, for example, a level of professional training. </p>
<h2>Requirements for Singing Teachers and Vocal Coaches</h2>
<p>Yes, there are specific requirements for the singing teachers&#8217; association, but the tragedy is that you don&#8217;t have to provide supporting documents to back up your claim of training. And that really sucks. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an honor system and people seeking membership check a box that says something about making a false claim. So, if you go to the national association what are you going to get? Not much, if you ask me. I was a member for quite some years, but my paid membership did nothing to help YOU. </p>
<h2>Seriously!</h2>
<p>Years ago when I received my first copy of the book from them that lists all the singing teachers, the first thing I noticed was that they didn&#8217;t list our qualifications. So I called them and asked why not&#8230;given that people looking for singing teachers, or maybe a vocal coach Los Angeles would want to know about someone&#8217;s qualifications right up front. </p>
<p>The answer I got was <strong>astounding</strong>. The guy said that if they listed everyone&#8217;s qualifications, it would be prejudicial against people whose qualifications weren&#8217;t very good, or, even worse against people who didn&#8217;t have qualifications at all. </p>
<p><strong>Fail, guys.</strong> Right there.</p>
<h2>Finding a Legitimate Vocal Coach Los Angeles</h2>
<p>There is an alternative to the singing teachers association, and it&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s the <a href=""https://www.mtna.org/"">Music Teachers National Association</a>. You might try finding a vocal coach or singing teacher there. </p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m mentioning them is because they&#8217;ve been around since 1876. Yep, you heard right. 1876. And an association that&#8217;s that old is probably going to be pretty good. They have a very uncomplicated search engine, too. So if you&#8217;re looking for a vocal coach Los Angeles, just fill in your zip code and select voice and how far you&#8217;re willing to travel, and up will come your choices. </p>
<p>The main things to check on are the qualifications that your prospective teacher has and their professional career. If you see a name that you think looks like a good fit for you, just reach out and ask them about their qualifications and their concerts and recordings. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not a bad idea to find somebody who&#8217;ll actually give you an introductory lesson or an initial consultation for free. That&#8217;s usually a good sign that you&#8217;re headed in the right direction.</p>

Using Slack, we encourage team-wide collaboration and discussion that was previously impossible. We have created channels for different subject and specialty areas, others for student leadership and mentors, and more for general discussion and announcements. The format also makes it easy to direct message individual members of the team when required, without looking up email addresses. We can discuss topics relating to specific matters or open discussions to the whole team. We even use it at competitions to get information out to all team members regardless of their location, using their mobile app.</div><div>Slack has additional utility as a file sharing platform. We post forms, videos, graphics files, and more. We are able to take quick polls to see who plans to attend an event. During a recent social media contest, the app automatically reminded everyone once every 24 hours to go vote for our team's submission. Events from our <a href=""https://calendar.google.com"">Google Calendar</a> are posted to Slack as well.</div><div>Slack not only accommodates professional conversation, but also gives us a way to communicate with team members in things not related to robotics at all. Fun off-topic channels keep the team engaged and forge connections between teammates. This casual conversation improves our synergy as a team and provides a great medium for sharing our love of <a href=""https://www.firstinspires.org/"">FIRST</a>!</div><div>We have also found that Slack is a Gouda way to keep our alumni engaged with the team.

Lacking the research resources to do so they went ahead and made something up. SCIENCE says you should only do this one thing as a New Year's Resolution.  Unfortunately, science was badly misrepresented--and a journalist missed an opportunity to talk about intuitive eating and the stigma of obesity. Mothers-to-be are smoking more pot than ever before (not a lot of research on that, either). And we learn that fatigue can be a symptom of nearly every illness, as well as the source of some great click-bait headlines. </p>

She did the The Yo, Rocky Film Tour with Rocky impersonator extraordinaire Mike Kunda. She later covered Robert Tepper's ""No Easy Way out"", and gives ol' Tepps a run for his money.         In this interview Ira talks about her childhood and how she was influenced by bands like Deep Purple, Pink Floyd and Alice in Chains.

We have a powerful full moon across Sagittarius & Gemini coming up this weekend - a Supermoon in fact!  That means there is a lot of energy flowing through the Earth right now.  This weekend also takes us into the next Mercury Rx!  We'll also look at the astrology for Dec and the Winter solstice.

When we pull a chart for the Ingress (moving into) of the solstice or equinox, it gives us an idea of the likely themes and energies we will be dealing with for the next 3 months...it's like looking through a crystal ball into the future :)  What will we see? 

Join us today at 4:00 pm PT / 7:00 pm ET on BlogTalk Radio. 

We will be doing some readings during the show today - dial 1-646-787-1519 for a look at your astrological chart.",2017-12-01 00:00:00+00

Wie zijn de mensen die de koers in de samenleving en economie bepalen en daarin leiderschap tonen? Die vraag is leidend voor onze reeks Leading People Power. Samen met Harry Starren gaan we in gesprek met mensen die koers bepalen. Wat staat ons te wachten? En wat is al aan het gebeuren? We gaan op zoek naar mensen die voorop lopen. Wat drijft hen? Waarom doen ze wat ze doen? En wat valt er van hen te leren? <br />

Yes, I'm totally drooling all over the mic this week in a very personal, raw and real interview with Michael Hutter (aka the man behind ""EC3."")

He was a big part of the counter cultural movement of the 60's, and with the rise of digital media there has been a surge of interest in his work through countless recorded audio and video lectures, as well as his books and writings.</p> <p>Join us for an intimate look into the life of the iconic Alan Watts, as we talk with two of his daughters, Anne and Joan Watts. We discuss the life of their father, things they learned growing up with him, and the impact he's had on their lives. Joan and Anne very candidly discussed who he was as a person and a father, and the struggles of living a spiritual life in the modern world. </p> <p>This was a deeply personal interview for me. I first found Alan's work when I was in highschool learning about Taoism. When I traveled abroad, I had countless hours of lectures that I listened to on my iPod, and to this day, I still listen to his lectures regularly. I wanted to know more about the person behind the writing and lectures. Who was he as a father? What were his struggles and successes? This interview was more intimate than any I've done before, but I hope it gives a inside look into the life of this iconic and treasured man. </p> <p>Anne and Joan recently released a book of collected letters from their father: <em>The Collected Letters of Alan Watts</em>, published by New World Library, and it's available wherever books are sold. </p> <p>---</p> <p>Anatomy of Living Podcast with Ashton Szabo</p> <p>The Life of Alan Watts - Conversation with Anne and Joan Watts [Episode 20]</p> <p>Credits:</p> <p>Special Guest: Anne Watts and Joan Watts</p> <p><a href=""http://www.annewatts.com"">www.annewatts.com</a></p> <p>Creator and Host: Ashton Szabo</p> <p>Intro and Outro Music: Emily Ann Peterson</p> <p> </p> Ashton Szabo <p>Facebook: www.facebook.com/anatomyofliving</p> <p>Instagram: @anatomyofliving</p> <p>Twitter: AnatomyofLiving</p> <a href= ""http://www.anatomyofliving.com/"">www.anatomyofliving.com</a>",2017-12-13 16:51:18+00

Today we take a look backward at what 2017's astrological transits have taught us.  What did we learn that prepares us for 2018?  Retrospective gives us perspective on what is to come.

This coming year starts out rather busy and sets the stage for more transformational work.  Of course the outer world will reflect this too.  Knowing what is coming helps you to better prepare for how you will be affected, and you can best use consciousness to move forward.    

Join us today at 4:00 pm PT / 7:00 pm ET on BlogTalk Radio.

And yes, our fertility is greatly influenced by age and genetics but equally(if not MORE)important is our bodies' physiological environment. Unfortunately, with the hundreds of toxic chemicals we're exposed to everyday, that means being proactive with our health and educating ourselves on hormonal wellness so that we can all make healthy babies when the time is right! This week on the podcast, we're chatting with Dr. Danika Sicard (a naturopathic doctor) all about NATURAL WAYS to boost fertility and correct hormonal imbalances. And I made sure to ask plenty of questions for both my female and male listeners. It's a very informative episode if I may say so myself.  Enjoy!",2017-12-13 04:09:05+00

Wat is de maatschappelijke bijdrage van jouw organisatie? Heb jij het antwoord direct klaar of moet je toch eerst even diep nadenken? Met het krapper worden van de arbeidsmarkt wordt ook de purpose of maatschappelijke bijdrage van jouw organisatie een steeds belangrijker onderscheidende waarde. Sterker nog Generatie Y ziet het als een van de belangrijkste arbeidsvoorwaarden. Luister naar Annette van Waning van Vebego over de leergang Shared Value die zij volgde bij Michael Porter. Jacobine DasGupta, directeur Brighter Living Solutions bij DSM vertelt over de positieve bijdrage van DSM in Rwanda. Jeroen Busscher bespiegelt over zingeving en Talitha Muuse reflecteert vanuit Generatie Y op de goede voorbeelden op de arbeidsmarkt.<br />

Things are escalating quickly, and now Governor Adelhard is dead.

Correct! One of the most famous people of the Victorian era, David Livingstone was a terrible missionary... But lucky for him he was a fantastic explorer. Travelling to Africa for three seperate epic adventures, he went to an incredible amount of places no other European person had ever been before him. He is also perhaps best remembered for his advocacy against slavery.&nbsp;<br><br>This week's episode is brought to you by the Harper Collins book 'How To Build A Universe' by the people behind The Infinite Monkey Cage; Professor Brian Cox, Robin Ince and Alexandra Feachem.</p>

Calling it such is a little disingenuous given that we do absolutely nothing to celebrate the holidays other than share our soccer-related gift guide, a.k.a our own personal audio Christmas wishlists. A number of listeners also shared their favorite soccer gifts they&#8217;ve received over the years, and we&#8217;ll sprinkle those in there, too.</p>
<p>Of course, we also covered two matchday&#8217;s worth of Premier League action. That includes delving into Manchester City&#8217;s incredible superiority to everyone else in world football, and Crystal Palace&#8217;s zombie/Jesus-like resurrection. We also tiptoed through the domestic offseason, though how much expansion news we included in that will have to be discovered by pressing the play button below.</p>

Then, we discuss a police officer who showed up to a trial just to taunt someone who shot him three times with...yup, KY Jelly.  Sal Zuno and Officer Sharketti, give that man a medal!

It is also generally quoted from the King James Version which reads, ""6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."". Again, many only quote, ""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:"". The King James Version is typically quoted because of its more poetic verse and ease of remembrance.

What we miss by not quoting the full verse is reference to The Holy Spirit; ""Wonderful, Counselor or Wonderful Counselor"": The Trinity, ""The mighty God""; The Father, ""The everlasting Father""; and the Son, Jesus, ""The Prince of Peace"". This verse displays the cohesiveness of the trinity. Because of the trinity, three in one, all these names apply to the child who is born and son who is given.

The word ""Given"" in the Greek: ""Nathan Naw - than"" in simplified form meaning, ""consecrate, pay wages, deliver up, appoint, to be given, be inflicted"".

Scripture supports the definition of the word, ""Given"". We are consecrated in Christ and His work on the cross as per both Philippians 3:8-11 and Romans 6:20-23. We also see in Romans 6:23 that the wages of sin is death. These wages were horrifically paid by Christ on the cross for us. This means we were bought with a price!

Kate O'Flynn continues Jon McGregor's gripping new series. A community is rocked when 13-year-old Becky Shaw goes missing on a holiday to the Peak District. Now her disappearance sparks long-buried memories, and opens old wounds. Today: a local woman remembers seeing Becky on an eventful night out the summer before...

The fifteen stories of The Reservoir Tapes each stand alone but together build a compelling portrait of a village shaken by tragedy, as they explore events that precede and follow the disappearance of the teenage Becky Shaw. A companion to Jon McGregor's critically acclaimed Man Booker long-listed novel Reservoir 13, these stories and their different perspectives offer tantalizing glimpses as what to might have happened to the teenage girl.
Writer: Jon McGregor is an acclaimed British novelist who has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize three times. His third novel, Even the Dogs, won the International Dublin Literary Award.

If you want to ask questions for the podcast, you can become a podcast insider <a href=""http://Patreon.com/carolinedooner"">over at Patreon by clicking here</a>.)<br />
<br />
When you start a meal thinking, ""I shouldn't eat too much of this,"" that's a diet.<br />
<br />
Meaning: it's diet mentality, it's fear of food, fear of amounts, an attempt at controlling from the outside in, it's fear of weight, and fear and mistrust of your appetite.<br />
<br />
Instead, thinking, ""I don't know that I want all of this"" is a totally different story. That's legit, you don't have to be hungry for everything on your plate. You don't have to want the food that is in front of you. But thinking 'I shouldn't eat too much of this.'  ????<br />
<br />
Why? Because a diet book once told you how much you should be hungry for? Because getting full scares you? WHY?<br />
<br />
If eating a meal, or eating certain food has the power to make you gain weight, you probably need to gain weight. Hear that again:<br />
If satiating your hunger makes you gain weight, you probably need to gain weight.<br />
Meaning, metabolically, if eating a big meal is going to change your weight? You should probably let it, because the main reason our weight yo-yos is because we are chronically underfed and metabolically compromised.<br />
<br />
Eat your fucking food. Food shoulds are bullshit. External, food-fearing, amount-fearing portion control is a diet.",2017-12-09 16:17:00+00

Neil Dudgeon continues Jon McGregor's gripping new series. A community is rocked when a teenager goes missing on a midwinter walk in the Peak District. Now her disappearance sparks long-buried memories, and opens old wounds. Today: a former quarry worker ponders the dangers of the local landscape...

The fifteen stories of The Reservoir Tapes each stand alone but together build a compelling portrait of a village shaken by tragedy, as they explore events that precede and follow the disappearance of the teenage Becky Shaw. A companion to Jon McGregor's critically acclaimed Man Booker long-listed novel Reservoir 13, these stories and their different perspectives offer tantalizing glimpses as what to might have happened to the teenage girl.
Writer: Jon McGregor is an acclaimed British novelist who has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize three times. His third novel, Even the Dogs, won the International Dublin Literary Award.

It is all through the prophecy of His birth, in His birth, and in the subsequent events of Jesus birth signifying the Trinity. Three-in-One. We will also see some little known facts recorded in history that prove knowledge of the three wise men is actually greater than many give credit in more recent times.

I believe the imprint of the Trinity is in all of the story of Jesus' birth as displayed by the frequency of three. Three wise men, three ways prophecy speaks, and three gifts just to point out the more obvious and visible parts of the pattern of three.

Why specifically, Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh? Could these three gifts, like no others, symbolize the life of Christ from birth to death? Could we, today in 2017, see parallels of symbolism in the gifts brought. In other words, a simple more modern symbolism that helps us understand just what this scripture is telling us.

In present times we believe the ""Star of Bethlehem"", as many call it, guided the three wise men to the place of baby King Jesus. In fact, the ""Star of Bethlehem"" played a far more significant role in events before and during the journey to bear gifts to Jesus.

Harold, an eclectic and voracious reader, began his venture in the world of the written word as a child of 2 years.  Scraps of paper, candy wrappers, dictionary's right through the entire encyclopedia Britannica. Yet Harold was driven to books of the sciences. Physics, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, he met them all with great wonder and fascination. He delved into each discipline as if his very life depended upon understanding its depth.

It was not until the words of The Hon. Elijah Muhammad that the essence and understanding of the sciences began to have true purpose and meaning. He said, ""all there is to know is written in a book, read"".

Harold began his collegiate pursuit at Hampton Institute; he then forayed to Fairleigh Dickenson University. At FDU the practice of the Social Sciences, public activism, and public speaking became a trusted part of mental fabric.

Harold is the husband to Celestine Muhammad, and the father of 10 extraordinary children, and 8 grandchildren. Harold has the benefit of having the most exceptional and wondrous teachers to whom he owes all that he has learned, will learn and knows to this very day, The Most  Hon. Elijah Muhammad, the Hon. Min. Louis Farrakhan, his Father Alfred Eatman, and his Grandfather  the Late Captain, Harold D. Hook.",2017-12-12 23:30:00+00

It was also written with very crude and offensive language. For this reason, I had to leave it once I got the idea of where this person was going with their blog. They also contended that the Three Magi were not Kings as much historical information contradicts. We have already seen that these three were not only Kings but, wise men. We'll start with Jesus' birth.

Luke 2:7 in the English Standard Version reads, ""And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.""

History supports the notion of Inns being in their infancy at the time Joseph and Mary came to Bethlehem. Lets see what history has to say about the coming of Inns.

We can see from the timing in Roman history that Inns, while in their infancy, did exist when Joseph and Mary came to Bethlehem. We also see in the history of Inns that they had a stable where a manger could easily be found.

Jacqueline Redgewell continues Jon McGregor's gripping series. A community is rocked when 13-year-old Becky Shaw goes missing on a midwinter walk in the Peak District. Now her disappearance sparks long-buried memories, and opens old wounds. Today: the local cleaner remembers an unexpected visitor...

The fifteen stories of The Reservoir Tapes each stand alone but together build a compelling portrait of a village shaken by tragedy, as they explore events that precede and follow the disappearance of the teenage Becky Shaw. A companion to Jon McGregor's critically acclaimed Man Booker long-listed novel Reservoir 13, these stories and their different perspectives offer tantalizing glimpses as what to might have happened to the teenage girl.
Writer: Jon McGregor is an acclaimed British novelist who has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize three times. His third novel, Even the Dogs, won the International Dublin Literary Award.

2 - Peace is spread everywhere this child is received. Jesus is the Prince of Peace.

Sara Kestelmanl continues Jon McGregor's gripping series. A community is rocked when 13-year-old Becky Shaw goes missing on a midwinter walk in the Peak District. Now her disappearance sparks long-buried memories, and opens old wounds. Today: a local woman's increasingly unreliable memories are taken back to the summer before...

The fifteen stories of The Reservoir Tapes each stand alone but together build a compelling portrait of a village shaken by tragedy, as they explore events that precede and follow the disappearance of the teenage Becky Shaw. A companion to Jon McGregor's critically acclaimed Man Booker long-listed novel Reservoir 13, these stories and their different perspectives offer tantalizing glimpses as what to might have happened to the teenage girl.
Writer: Jon McGregor is an acclaimed British novelist who has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize three times. His third novel, Even the Dogs, won the International Dublin Literary Award.

We also want to extend to all our listeners warm Christmas wishes. I hope God blesses you all. I hope Christmas will be a rich time of His blessings, family and friends. We hope that you find that special blessing God has for you no matter where you may be.

In 2018 we are looking to launch our Web site. It is mostly coded at this point and the finishing touches are being put on it now. Our present host where Brother John hosts his Photography Web site has fixed Security Certificate issues and we now sport an A-Plus Security Rating at SSL Labs.

Our highest goal is to plant a church of seekers and Un-Churched Christians. Seekers need a place to start and many of God's Un-Churched need a Christ-Centered loving community to once again thrive in.

We hope you find this study most instructive. Get your sharp pencil, paper and Bible out! Then click Play!

I also want to thank the good folks at www.bensound.com for our closing music. Thanks for your efforts in providing Acoustic Breeze. The full tracks can be heard at these Web sites.

Happy holidays! In this wintry episode of FRR, Annie and Ben take on the unnecessarily difficult task of writing new Christmas songs from scratch, on the spot. Armed with a miniature and severely out-of-tune piano, Annie's quick wit, and Ben's limited musical knowledge, will they succeed? If not, at least they can sit back and relax for the holidays, knowing they had fun talking about Christmas traditions and ambitions prior.

In the third episode of FRR, Annie and Ben finally dive into their ever-growing Ask.fm feed to address the quickly-accumulating stockpile of bizarre submitted questions. Next, a brief ReCall segment sees Annie's old friend Mikaela Hughes interviewed, before the most intense of moments in FRR's brief history takes place in the form of an all-out verbal fight to determine whether or not the classic treat of pizza is best enjoyed with the toppings placed on top of or underneath the cheese layer.

Tamsin Greig reads the penultimate story in Jon McGregor's gripping 15-part series. A Peak district village has been rocked by the disappearance of teenager Becky Shaw on a midwinter walk on the moors. The aftershocks of the tragedy continue to ripple through the community, sparking memories, opening old wounds, and prompting new stories. Now, a family friend thinks back to a memorable meal on the bitterly cold night before Becky and her family returned to the village...

The fifteen stories of The Reservoir Tapes each stand alone but together build a compelling portrait of a community rocked by tragedy, as they explore events that precede and follow the disappearance of the teenage girl. A prequel to Jon McGregor's critically acclaimed Man Booker longlisted novel Reservoir 13, these stories and their different perspectives offer tantalizing glimpses as to what might have happened to Becky.

Writer: Jon McGregor is an acclaimed British novelist who has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize three times. His third novel, Even the Dogs, won the International Dublin Literary Award.
Reader: Tamsin Greig, is an Olivier Award-winning stage and TV actor, known best for her roles in Episodes, Black Books and Friday Night Dinner.

With most of the key starters likely resting, the Steelers will need some good performances from backups. If the Steelers can beat the Browns (handing them a tie for the worst record all time) then they will have a chance to secure the #1 Seed in the AFC Playoffs. But for that to happen, the Steelers would need the Jets to defeat the Patriots as well. Austin and John are back to talk about the game and the potential ramifications of several games in this final week of regular season action.

For now though Austin and John are back to comment on that play and the sequence following the overturned touchdown and why the Steelers had nobody to blame but themselves at the end of the game.  However, make no mistake about it, the Steelers were the better team for most of the game on Sunday and should feel very good about a rematch in the playoffs.

What effect does a clinician have on the ""bio""? When and how should the ""psychosocial"" element be addressed? Should we take a ""structuralist"" or ""pain science"" approach when diagnosing and managing injury? Is it a dichotomy?<br /><br />We also discuss, at length, the existence and management of fascial adhesions. What are adhesions? Can we identify them with palpation? Can we make structural changes with manual interventions?<br /><br />We would like to thank Dr. Brady for coming on this show.

1616,178,Always Advent,https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.nm-storage.com/collegechurch/downloads/12_3_17_podcast_edit.mp3,1461,"Advent comes from a Latin word meaning ""coming,"" or ""arrival."" It is a four-Sunday season of preparation for the celebration of Christmas. As the Jewish people waited for and looked forward to the arrival of the Messiah, so we also look forward to celebrating the Messiah having arrived. The season of Advent is therefore a time of eager waiting, and Advent teaches us how we are to be always: eagerly waiting for the Lord's coming. The scriptures that we will be reading throughout Advent revolve around the theme of waiting for and anticipating the Lord's coming. Who knows? Perhaps He will visit us today! Let's look for His coming.<br />
<br />
Scriptures: Isaiah 64:1-9<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Psalm 80<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;1 Corinthians 1:2-9<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Mark 13:24-37<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>""GOD IS SAVNG YOU""</strong><br />
&#160;<br />
The Epistle Reading for the first Sunday of Advent was from <strong>1 Corinthians 1:2-9</strong>. The reading was selected no doubt because in that passage, Paul characterizes how the Corinthians were to wait for the Second Advent of our Lord. They were to <em>eagerly</em> wait.<br />
But what is remarkable about this passage is the confidence that Paul has that the Corinthians were being sanctified and that they would be kept blameless when the Lord returned. That is remarkable because of the character of that Corinthian church.<br />
&#160;<br />
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What were some of the issues that were plaguing the church at Corinth?<br />
&#160;<br />
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Are any of the issues of the first century church relevant to our day? Do contemporary churches have the same problems?<br />
&#160;<br />
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Would you have attended this church?&#160; Why or why not?<br />
&#160;<br />
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Did Paul mean what he wrote in <strong>1 Cor 1:2-9</strong>? How could he have been that confident of their future?<br />
&#160;<br />
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So is God saving us or are we saving ourselves?<br />
&#160;<br />
6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What difference does it make to trust in God for our salvation rather than ourselves?<br />
&#160;<br />
7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So is He saving you?<br />

His baptism was a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins and Mark tells us that ""<em>the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized...</em>"" (<strong>Mark 1:5</strong>) It would have been quite a dramatic scene, to see <em>the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem</em> confessing their sins and submitting to a baptism of repentance.....and then Jesus showed up.<br />
<br />
Scriptures: Isaiah 40:1-5<br />

<br />
<strong>Reflection Questions</strong><br />
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Is it at all surprising that people were willing to undergo a public baptism of repentance?<br />
&#160;<br />
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What would have motivated them to confess and repent of their sins publicly?<br />
&#160;<br />
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What place does confession and repentance have in our salvation?<br />
&#160;<br />
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What happens when we confess and repent of our sins?<br />
&#160;<br />
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In light of the result of honest confession and repentance, why are we usually reluctant to do so?<br />
&#160;<br />
6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Should we be willing to do so? And what might it say about us that we would be willing to do so?<br />
&#160;<br />
7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So what does confession and repentance truly indicate?<br />

1865,439,Episode 100: GOTYcast: The Friendly Part,https://hoppedupgaming.hipcast.com/deluge/hoppedupgaming-20171213031540-6546.mp3,5673,"This is the nice half of our annual GOTY Double-header. In this section every member of the team comes with their favourite individual lists of games they played in 2017. We gush about what we liked, and it's a real feel-goodery. *Next week* is when we sharpen our knives and try to kill each-other's favourite virtual children, in the process of determining our overall game of the year.

Also, Mike realizes that he needs to ""Git Gud"", Matt forgets that the name John isn't the same as Matt, David discovers the hidden secret of the name ""Fortnite"", Kelly isn't on his first MMO rodeo, and Norris shockingly enough still loves indie games. 

Hosts: Chris Norris-Jones, David Beebe, Kelly Wright, Mike Parker,

1884,178,Not Just John,https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.nm-storage.com/collegechurch/downloads/12_17_17.mp3,1391,"During Advent, the scripture readings refer to the story of John the Baptist. When we are looking forward to and preparing for the celebration of the Messiah's having arrived, it is very appropriate to read about John the Baptist, who was looking forward to and preparing for the actual event of the Messiahs arrival. And John the Evangelist tells us that John the Baptist was ""<em>sent </em><em>from God... as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe,"" </em>but what if John teh Evangelist wasn&#39;t only speaking about John?<br />
<br />
Scriptures: Isaiah 61:1-3, 8-11<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;1 Thessalonians 5:16-24<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;John 1:6-13, 16-29<br />
<br />
&#160;<br />
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Do you ever consider that you have been sent from God? What might it mean to think of yourself as having been sent?<br />
&#160;<br />
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What difference would it make in your life if you considered that your primary purpose was to be a witness to the Christ?&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; What would change?<br />
&#160;<br />
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Does God really need us to be witnesses? Can't others come to know Christ without us?<br />
&#160;<br />
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So what does it mean ""<em>to witness</em>?"" How are we to witness to the Christ?<br />
&#160;<br />
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To whom do we witness? For whom has the Lord made you responsible?<br />
&#160;<br />
6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And what are the obstacles? What gets in the way of our being witnesses for Christ?<br />
&#160;<br />
7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So how do we become more faithful witnesses to the Christ?<br />

<p><em>Welcome fellow travellers through Time and Space!</em></p>
<p><em>We are most grateful that you have chosen to take a short interdimensional trip with us!</em></p>
<p>This episode of <strong>That's Great, Adric</strong> is a study of <em>Peter Capaldi's</em> <strong>12th Doctor</strong>. Although the word ""study"" was likey the over-looked <em>noun</em> in that statement of intent, this episode of <strong>TGA</strong> is intended to be a celebration of <strong>The 12th Doctor</strong>.<br>
<em>SeannieWan</em> begins a highly-complex verbal assault against the <strong>Annals of Time</strong> and VICTORY is the only option. <em>Peter Capaldi</em> belongs at the very top of the actors that have played <em>The Doctor</em> food chain. <em>Peter Capaldi</em> is the Tyrannosaurus Rex of <strong>Doctor Who</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, we will be taking an in-depth look at... the major series-long themes and thematic elements of Series 8, 9, and 10 and how these plotlines and ideas change <em>The 12th Doctor</em>.  </p>
<p><strong>That's Great, Adric</strong>... </p>
<p>A <em>Doctor Who</em> Podcast... and it's really really great.  </p>
<p><em>Adric</em>  would like to quietly acknowledge, and <em>SeannieWan</em> would like to give a great, big shout-out to <strong>Andrew Allen</strong> for his unbelievably creative <em>Doctor Who Funk Theme</em>. </p>

We discuss how loneliness is distinct from things like depression and social isolation, how it's possible to be surrounded by family and friends and still feel lonely, how feeling lonely can have a negative impact on our long term physical health, and why we as a society are guilty of neglecting our older generation.

There will not be a new episode until January 13th so please accept this humble offering for now and have a wonderful X-Mas and an explosive New Year. Be seeing you... in 2018.

<br />
When you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit &#8220;tasty&#8221;. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you.-George Orwell<br />
Good habits are worth being fanatical about. -John Irving<br />
Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits.-Mark Twain<br />
<br />
The Art of War is to me The Art of the Diet.  I initially named this blog in the fine art use of &#8220;Art of&#8221;. I had developed a whole new <a href=""http://www.thephotogardener.com"">portfolio</a> of fruits and vegetables as a way of learning to eat and enjoy more of these food groups.  That strategy worked. I now love them and look forward to eating them.<br />
But, as I've maintained for seven years this weight loss, I realize the Art of the Diet is less about its fine art meaning and more about the Art of War meaning: skills acquired by experience, study, observation of your strengths and weaknesses and knowing your enemy's strengths and weaknesses.  The archaic meaning of the art of something is &#8220;a skillful plan&#8221;.<br />
THIS IS A REBROADCAST OF ONE OF THE ESSENTIALS OF EIGHT YEARS OF MAINTAINING A SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS.  I HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN. I MAY NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW THE PLAN PERFECTLY BUT I HAVE TO HAVE ONE.  NEXT WEEK, WEDNESDAY, JAN 3, 2018, I'LL BE BACK TO A NEW SEASON OF PODCASTS. SHARING MY THOUGHTS ON MY NEWEST PLAN AND OTHER NEW THINGS. A COMBINATION OF SCIENCE, COMMERCIALISM, AND MY OWN PERSONALITY.  THE LATTER IS WHAT IS RARELY DISCUSSED IN ALL THE PLANS OF THE FIRST TWO CATEGORIES BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN MY EXPERIENCE.<br />
Every once in a while I post some real time short videos on my <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/artofthediet"">Facebook</a> page.  Some of them are even in focus.  Come and visit.<br />
<br />
So, today, we talk about the need for skillful plans made up of daily habits that can be used as strategies to combat the challenges of our bodies, which like it or not, are agitating behind the scenes to regain our lost pounds.<br />
It doesn't depress me to know this. It energizes me.  I hope this is the message you get from this episode 41 of PODSNACKS, Art of Diet &amp; War.<br />

<p>Welcome fellow travellers through Time and Space!  </p>
<p>We are most grateful that you have chosen to listen to us.  </p>
<p>This episode of <strong>That's Great, Adric</strong> is <strong>TGA</strong> initial analysis of the 2017 <strong>Doctor Who</strong> <em>Christmas Episode</em>, <strong>Twice Upon a Time</strong>.  </p>
<p>In our <em>Initial Thoughts</em> episode, we take a look at <strong>Twice Upon a Time</strong> more as a <strong>Doctor Who</strong> Christmas Story and less as a a <em>Regeneration Story/Final Production of Long-Time Script Editor/Multi-Doctor Story</em>. <em>Adric</em> will be the first to admit that it isn't east.<br>
<strong>Twice Upon a Time- Initial Thoughts</strong> is the 2nd installment of our celebration of <em>Peter Capaldi</em> and <strong>The 12th Doctor</strong>- <strong>P.Capz Is Our Doctor</strong> (working title). </p>
<p><strong>That's Great, Adric</strong>... </p>
<p>A <em>Doctor Who</em> Podcast... and it's really really great.  </p>
<p><em>Adric</em>  would like to quietly acknowledge, and <em>SeannieWan</em> would like to give a great, big shout-out to <strong>Andrew Allen</strong> for his unbelievably creative <em>Doctor Who Funk Theme</em>. </p>
<p>You can find more of his work on his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/KEYSwithSOUL"">YouTube Page</a>.  </p>

First, Kornflake's 1991 edition of National Whatever Day celebrates the debut of Ren and Stimpy, a show considered quite outrageous in its time. How innocent we were. Kornflake has also made her annual pilgrimage to the lobster trap Christmas tree up in Maine (a weird crustacean-themed holiday tradition, but why not). Meanwhile, Kevin ran around Boston like a maniac all week, and has concert reports on Letters to Cleo, Blake Babies, Squeeze, and Niki Luparelli and the Gold Diggers (with Lipstick Criminals). In other words, we're exhausted. But we still manage to play a round of Figgy Pudding Pages and come up with a wacky new holiday money-making scheme. (Listen to the show for details, but in short: If everyone knocks their Christmas trees over, we'll be filthy rich.)</p>",2017-12-03 15:20:00+00

We can't promise podcast perfection but we can promise two other great movie podcasts to inspire our discussion on Rotten Tomatoes Perfection and the new film LADY BIRD. On the <a href=""http://www.sanspantsradio.com/movie-maintenance/"">MOVIE MAINTENANCE</a> podcast the hosts discuss the current film offerings weighing heavily on the positive reaction to BABY DRIVER while over on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/little-gold-men/id1042433465?mt=2"">LITTLE GOLD MEN</a> there is a fear of how Greta Gerwig's movie will be perceived by the filmgoing public with the perfect Rotten Tomatoes score attached to it. Take solace dear listener in that you have attached yourself to this great podcast and we will never have such glowing reviews that would only disappoint you later.<br />

In <a href=""https://www.amandaagogo.com/amandaspictureshowagogo/"">AMANDA'S PICTURE SHOW A GO GO</a> the balance between comedy and drama is praised in summer hit THE BIG SICK and on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/celluloid-heroes/id1162512496?mt=2"">CELLULOID HEROES</a> the hosts bring back <a href=""https://markasplayed.podbean.com/"">MARK AS PLAYED</a> favorite in the hitman romcom GROSSE POINTE BLANK.

If you follow any of my social media channels, you&#8217;ll be well aware that I&#8217;ve been working on a brand new food podcast since November. My aim has been to learn, and boy have I learned. I&#8217;m so interested in how other people live their lives, and food is a fantastic marker of our differences. In series one I&#8217;ve focused solely on interviewing my friends and family so as to gently ease myself in to podcasting. What this did was create a cosy, relaxed and familiar environment that I hope will be as much of a pleasure to listen to as it was to be in. I didn&#8217;t expect to learn so much from people that I knew so well already. It&#8217;s been such a fantastic experience for me. If you share my fascination for other humans, I think you&#8217;ll enjoy what&#8217;s to come. I hope you&#8217;ll forgive the less-than-perfect recording conditions early on.

On this episode we ask you to ironically enjoy our latest episode on THE DISASTER ARTIST and ironic enjoyment at the movies. To do so we actually enjoy a couple of other movie podcasts on this outbreak of detachment occuring in modern film fandom. <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/firsttimewatchers"">FIRST TIME WATCHERS</a> and <a href=""http://www.earwolf.com/show/the-canon/"">THE CANON</a> join James Franco in enlightening the world on all that is good about bad cinema, but we also hold out hope that these great shows can also point out all the good in our bad podcast! If not, we just point you in their direction. Enjoy!<br />

On this episode our hosts <a href=""https://twitter.com/AtlanticSC"">Jason</a> of <a href=""https://atlanticscreenconnection.com/"">ATLANTIC SCREEN CONNECTION</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/TruBromanceCast"">Jairo</a> of <a href=""http://truebromancepodcast.libsyn.com/"">THE TRUE BROMANCE FILM PODCAST</a> talk about their hopes, dreams, fears, and axieties for the latest chapter in the STAR WARS saga: THE LAST JEDI. But what they don't talk about are any of the early reviews that have come out about this film. The subject for this episode is Critic Proof Cinema, which ranges from fan favorites such as HARRY POTTER to film snob untouchables like PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON. How do we approach movies that we have already developed such an affinity for? To help answer that question we recommend two more great movie podcasts in <a href=""http://www.linoleum-knife.com/"">LINOLEUM KNIFE</a> and <a href=""http://redlettermedia.com/best-of-the-worst/"">RED LETTER MEDIA's BEST OF THE WORST</a>.<br />

And the Mayor is here to present a Top 4 1/2 List of Mayors! Specifically, all those wacky mayors from our favorite holiday cartoons! You may recall the mayor from 'Twas the Night Before Christmas (who freaked out over Mr. Trundle's broken clock) and the mayor from The Year Without a Santa Claus (who had to deal with those pesky Miser Brothers). But we cover some lesser known mayors too... including an evil mayor voiced by Charles Nelson Reilly! Yes, that really happened, and it was wonderful. Also: Tracy Bonham, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, the ESO Book Club, a Christmas Crustacean edition of What's in the Bag, and yes, evil gorillas. It's everything you need for a perfect holiday season. Enjoy.</p>",2017-12-17 21:04:22+00

His grandfather was an eminent musician and also called Ludwig van Beethoven. His father, who was not as talented as Beethoven's grandfather, drank heavily and died when Beethoven was still young. It was his move to Vienna that allowed him to flourish, with the support at first of aristocratic patrons, when that city was the hub of European music. He is credited with developing the symphony further than any who preceded him, with elevating instrumental above choral music and with transforming music to the highest form of art. He composed his celebrated works while, from his late twenties onwards, becoming increasingly deaf.

Before the live broadcast, BBC Radio 3's Breakfast programme will play selections from Beethoven, with Essential Classics playing more, immediately after, on the same network.

This is our silliest episode to date and a dream come true. Cory Branan and Jon Snodgrass are two of our all-time favorite songwriters. Branan's new record <em>Adios</em> was released in 2017 and is one of our favorite records of the year. Snodgrass is best known for his work with Drag the River but also has an excellent solo catalog as well as work with the bands Scorpios and Armchair Martian. We joke about Jon's indecipherable emails and proclivity for 'playing' drums, dive deep into political waters, and discuss the creative process for each of these brilliant writers.   </p> <p><a href=""https://www.corybranan.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel= ""noopener"">corybranan.com</a></p> <p><a href=""https://jonsnodgrass.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel= ""noopener"">jonsnodgrass.com</a></p>",2017-12-21 22:57:26+00

I hope you&#8217;re not missing me too much throughout the unplanned blogging break that I&#8217;ve spontaneously taken over the Christmas holidays. I was let off work early and thought it might be nice to just take a couple of weeks, recharge my batteries and live my life without worrying about content creation. It&#8217;s been lush, and I&#8217;m totally ready to come back full steam ahead in January. In the mean time, I have a new episode of the podcast for you. I spoke with my Grandparents about how food has changed in the time that they&#8217;ve been alive. Spoiler alert: it&#8217;s changed bloody loads. I really loved recording to this and talking to people that aren&#8217;t in their twenties because it&#8217;s nice to get a genuinely different voice and perspective out there.

It is the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, encouraged by his father's ghost to take revenge on his uncle who murdered him, and is set at the court of Elsinore. In soliloquies, the Prince reveals his inner self to the audience while concealing his thoughts from all at the Danish court, who presume him insane. Shakespeare gives him lines such as 'to be or not to be,' 'alas, poor Yorick,' and 'frailty thy name is woman', which are known even to those who have never seen or read the play. And Hamlet has become the defining role for actors, men and women, who want to show their mastery of Shakespeare's work. 

The image above is from the 1964 film adaptation, directed by Grigori Kozintsev, with Innokenty Smoktunovsky as Hamlet.

'Twas a horrifying year overall (did you notice?), but we got through it together, and managed to have some fun here on our goofy little show. Our convention schedule was busy this year; highlights included our meeting with Judy Tenuta, our defense of Howard the Duck, and our final shocking confrontation with Greg Brady. We also brought you dozens of concert reports on the most exciting new artists of today, including Richard Marx, Men Without Hats, and Air Supply. (We define ""today"" as ""at least 30 years ago."") And of course, 2017 also brought us a new Earth Station One book (have you read Kevin's weird chicken story yet?), a wonderful old Love Boat script, our ten-part review of High Feather (you're welcome!)... and the return of Robolar from Mars. But now it's time to look forward, as we also reveal our ridiculous New Year's Resolutions, and announce our schedule for Boston's favorite science fiction convention, Arisia!

I began my story-telling journey first with my dolls, then it progressed to paper. I have a deep love for anything romantic, and I'm a believer that in love anything is possible. 

 

I write (mostly) strong, witty and intelligent women who love fiercely. And strong, sexy, intelligent men - alpha heroes with a heart of gold. Then I add in my own little fantasy - they can all cook.

 

Most of my stories involve people with problems bigger than just trying to find love. I like making peace with the past, re-kindling old flames and healing old wounds. I love small towns, second chances, cowboys, rock stars, and men in uniform.

When I was much younger I was often an impertinent child deserving of punishment (according to my parents). One of the favored forms of punishment (after the obligatory spanking) was to take away my television watching privileges. There was a 3 year span where I was not allowed to watch television at all. The best thing to come out of all this was that I needed to find other ways to entertain myself. I escaped into books.

Timothy's writings began as something very private and very personal. It was a form ofjournaling for him.

From a very early age Timothy secretly began to suffer from serious bouts of anxiety and depression; emotions that he simply did not understand. He discovered early on that reading and writing were a healthy escape from these up and down, unexplained emotions.

As Timothy reached his mid-teens, his secret battle with anxiety and depression only deepened. Like so many people, he began masking those negative feelings with getting high, drunk and engaging in other negative behaviors.

Thus, the nomadic journey that is NOMAD began.

Today, Timothy lives in Sunny Florida with his wife, Tina. They have six adult children and enjoy being grandparents to several grandchildren.

Timothy continues to seek out his life passion: To teach others how to avoid the unhealthy nomad life. And to teach those who have found themselves trapped in that solitary place, how to find new hope and meaning for their lives, through Christ.",2017-12-09 01:00:00+00

<BR><BR><b>Overview:</b> Child Protective Services tyrannize families, aid in adoption, and use public monies to pay for foster care. These tyrannical systems were largely espoused by liberals like Walter Mondale, Richard Nixon, and LBJ. How do Christians interact with systems that are patently unbiblical and refuse to submit to biblical law- We draw a distinction between good Christians who are within bad systems, and the systems themselves. We also contrast government coerced redistribution of wealth and real heart-deep charity. Christians must displace these ungodly systems with church-based systems.----This program includes-----1.

4435,814,Do You Have Trouble Sleeping? | PYHP 016,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHP-Episode016Sleepedited.mp3?podcast_id=3642,1926,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><h3>Do you have trouble falling asleep?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons that people have trouble falling asleep. Reasons for poor sleep quality vary from medications, menopause, chronic pain to travel. For this episode, we want to talk about stress and its effect on your sleep.</p>
<p>Stress can come in many forms from physical to mental. Stress can include cardiovascular exercise to arguing with a family member. It can include planning a wedding or graduation party. We are always going to have stress, but stress can certainly have a negative impact on your sleep. It does this by increasing your cortisol at night.</p>
<p>Cortisol is an essential hormone. Without it, we would not be able to live. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands in a diurnal curve. Meaning, it is highest in the morning, so you wake up bright eyed and ready to start your day.</p>
<p>And the levels drop in the evening and nighttime so that we can sleep and rest. During periods of stress, this diurnal curve becomes disrupted. The cortisol starts to rise at night, and that causes people to have trouble falling asleep.</p>
<p>Not only do people have trouble falling asleep but the cortisol then will drop in the morning, which makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning. Of course, people end up pressing the snooze button over and over. Have you ever heard the term,  I get a second wind at night?&#8221; This is the effect of cortisol being elevated at night.</p>
<p>Many of our patients comment on how great they feel after 8:00 pm. How they finally feel like being productive, such as doing responding to emails, doing the laundry or washing the dishes. But will complain how tired and unproductive they feeling in the morning. Below are a few obvious ways to help reduce cortisol at night to help you fall asleep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the gym after 6:00 pm. Working out, especially intense cardiovascular exercise will raise cortisol. However, walking is a great way to get exercise at night, but should not increase cortisol excessively.</li>
<li>Turn off the TV, Ipad, iPhone, computer and yes, turn off Netflix at night. The light from these devices will make your body think it s daytime. And the exciting TV shows will get your cortisol rising as well. Reading is an excellent way to help you fall asleep. The eye movement of left to right actually helps people fall asleep.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine past 12:00 pm noon. Caffeine can stay in your system for 8 to 12 hours, causing you trouble falling asleep later that night.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplements to help you fall asleep:</p>
<p>We have developed sleep protocols for falling asleep and staying asleep. Click on the link to be directed to the <a href=""https://shop.progressyourhealth.com/products/sleep-protocol-1"" xlink=""href"">Sleep Protocol I.</a></p>
<h3>Do you have trouble staying asleep?</h3>
<p>Having trouble staying asleep is one of the most common complaints I get from patients. They report having no trouble falling asleep the second their head hits the pillow. But from there, I see two common themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up 3 hours later, wide awake and will be up for 1-3 hours. And by the time they do fall back to sleep, it is time to wake up for the day.</li>
<li>Fall asleep hard for 2-4 hours then waking multiple times for the rest of the night.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons people have trouble staying asleep, from health conditions to noisy neighbors. But in the case, it is from elevated levels of cortisol in the evening. Stress, whether it s  good stress  from moving into your dream home or a new better paying job promotion.</p>
<p>Or be it  bad stress  from having a conflict with family members. Or you have many responsibilities weighing on your shoulders. Stress causes cortisol levels to rise in the middle of the night, making it difficult to stay asleep. There are a few things you can do to help reduce the cortisol levels at night to stay asleep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a bedtime snack before bed. Eating something before bed will help to balance your blood sugar at night, so it does not drop in the middle of the night and wake you up.</li>
<li>No caffeine after 12:00 pm noon. Caffeine has a surprisingly long half-life and can be in your system up to 10 hours.</li>
<li>No intense cardiovascular exercise past 6:00 pm. Cardiovascular exercise does increase your cortisol. Walking, light stretching or light exercise will not raise your cortisol.</li>
<li>Try to minimize alcohol intake.  Drinking wine in the evening can help you relax after a long day, but can backfire and keep you awake later during the night.</li>
<li>Try to stay off your TV, Ipad, Phone, computer before bed. The light from these devices will make your body think it is daylight and raise your cortisol.</li>
</ul>

4485,814,Why Do I Get Hot Flashes? | PYHP 017,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode017-HotFlashesedited.mp3?podcast_id=3772,1840,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>First off, who gets hot flashes and night sweats? There are medical conditions, medications that can cause hot flashes and night sweats. But commonly, hot flashes and night sweats are a  female thing.  I know&#8230; us ladies are so complicated. But so worth it!</p>
<p>Why do women get hot flashes and men do not? Why do you hit every red light when you re late? Why do you always pick the slowest lane at the grocery store? Why does it rain after you wash your car? Because we are complicated! Because we have lots of hormones, A LOT of them.</p>
<p>I am a female, and basically, 80% of my patients are women. So I can tell you, we are a full philharmonic orchestra of hormones. And if one musician is out of tune, it makes the entire symphony sound  off.  Hot flashes and night sweats are one of the many symptoms that can occur with hormonal changes.</p>
<p>Fellas, on the other hand, have ONE instrument in their orchestra. I will let you envision what instrument that is. So back to hot flashes and night sweats.</p>
<p>What are hot flashes? Described as suddenly you get a premonition of  something.  Then there it goes, a heated flush that starts from within and emanates out. There can be sweating, or like us, ladies call it,  dewy  or just plain ole hot.</p>
<p>When you have a hot flash, the heat from your internal core radiates out. It is not entirely understood why the heat from the core expands to the periphery. Most women say they get heated in the torso, the face, and neck. They can get little sweat droplets on their face, and the hair at the nape of the neck can become damp from the sweat. Hot flashes can occur randomly, or a stressful situation can trigger them. When someone is having a hot flash, you can feel the heat emanating off of them.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Hot Flashes vs. Night Sweats? </strong></p>
<p>There are many kinds of night sweats. Ranging from waking during the night and fanning the sheets. To sleeping on towels and changing jammies.</p>
<p>Spouses/partners will complain that they are freezing. They sleep burrowed under a down comforter, while you are in thin PJs and have a fan pointed at you. The trouble with night sweats is they prevent good, rested sleep.</p>
<p>So here comes the domino-effect of night sweats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exhausted in the day</li>
<li>Waking up not-rested</li>
<li>Irritable, because everyone knows a sleep-deprived person is a grumpy person</li>
<li>Forgetful in the day</li>
<li>Wanting to nap in the afternoon</li>
<li>Weight gain: yes, not sleeping at night can and will contribute to weight gain in the belly</li>
</ul>
<p>Night sweats are a hot flash occurring at night when you are sleeping. But most people describe night sweats as more intense than daytime hot flashes. Because at night our immune system will raise our core temperature. It does this to help destroy viruses and to detoxify. If our temperature is already rising a bit, that can instigate or exacerbate a hot flash at night. It is common for people to experience night sweats but not hot flashes during the day.</p>
<p>There are many treatments for hot flashes and night sweats. Commonly these involve medications such as antidepressants and sleeping pills. These medications are habit-forming and have side effects. Hormone treatment such as bio-identical hormone replacement can be helpful. But hormones are not indicated for everyone depending on their personal and family health history.</p>
<p><strong>Simple recommendations for reducing hot flashes and night sweats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to reduce stress as much as possible, listen to <a href=""http://progressyourhealth.com/podcast/what-are-the-effects-of-stress-on-body/"" xlink=""href"">episode 15</a></li>
<li>Reduce caffeine and coffee as these can exacerbate hot flashes and night sweats</li>
<li>Reduce alcohol intake. Especially wine, which can exacerbate night sweats.</li>
<li>Increase your water intake. Hot flashes and night sweats can cause dehydration leading to cramping.</li>
<li>Improve sleep quality, listen to <a href=""http://progressyourhealth.com/podcast/trouble-sleeping-pyhp-016/"" xlink=""href"">episode 16</a></li>

<BR><BR><b>Overview:</b> Can somebody be a conservative Christian and still be pro-abortion---We take a look at a Pro-abort Tomi Lahren and her recent convocation speech for Liberty University. Also, studies find husbands whose wives retain their maiden names are perceived to be lacking the pants -and disempowered-. Are Christians concerned with empowerment or disempowerment- We are more interested in unity, that no person do anything that would separate the two which God has made one.-----This program includes------1.

4497,814,My Doctor Will Only Test TSH for My Thyroid | PYHP 018,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode18-TSHTestingedited.mp3?podcast_id=3862,1510,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>&#8220;My doctor will only test my TSH level for my thyroid. He/She says my thyroid is normal based on my TSH level, but I feel I have a thyroid problem! </p>
<p>I hear this all the time with my new patients. They have been to their internist, their primary care, and even endocrinologists, but they get the same answer,  your thyroid is normal, and you are fine. <br />
I&#8217;ve had patients tell me their doctors offer antidepressants, sleeping pills and birth control for their  symptoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some have even been referred to psychiatrists and therapists. Endocrinologists, internists, your primary care are looking for a disease. If you have a disease, they are trained to diagnose and treat the condition.<br />
Be it with medications, therapy or surgery; they could very well save your life. But that is if you have a disease. What happens if you do not have a disease? What happens if you don&#8217;t have a &#8216;disease,&#8217; but you still don t feel well?</p>
<p>You go to your doctor stating:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am exhausted, and my hair s falling out</li>
<li>I ve got dry skin and constipation</li>
<li>I am gaining weight even though I eat well and try to exercise</li>
<li>I am irritable, weepy and my family is concerned</li>
<li>My periods are off, my periods are heavy, my periods are painful</li>
<li>I have no sex drive</li>
<li>I have trouble falling asleep, I have trouble staying asleep</li>
<li>My short term memory is gone, I can t focus, do I have dementia? </li>
</ul>
<p>The reference range for TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.45 ng/dl to 4.5 ng/dL</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said, your conventional doctor is looking for a disease, so if your level falls within the range, then your thyroid is considered &#8216;normal,&#8217; regardless of your symptoms.</p>
<p>The TSH level is necessary to find thyroid disease. What you are looking for is thyroid function tests. We like to run the following tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>TSH</li>
<li>Free T4</li>
<li>Free T3</li>
</ul>
<p>The T4 hormone is what the thyroid gland makes, and releases into the bloodstream. The hormone T4 (Thyroxine) is an inactive hormone. Once in the blood, your body converts T4 into T3, which is the active form of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>Approximately 60% of this conversion occurs in the liver. To find out if the thyroid function is causing your symptoms, ordering a Free T4, Free T3 and TSH would be the first step. Now interpreting those results is another story, which we will cover in the next episode of the Progress Your Health Podcast.</p>

4521,814,What Are The Best Blood Tests for Thyroid Function? | PYHP 019,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode019-ThyroidFunctionedited.mp3?podcast_id=3877,1736,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most common test for thyroid is the TSH, which stands for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. Unfortunately, this is also the only test most conventional doctors use to screen for thyroid disease.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the TSH is elevated (above 4.5 mIU/L), you are hypothyroid, and if the number is low (below 0.45 ng/dL), you are hyperthyroid.  Yes, this is a bit hard to understand because it is the opposite of what we could expect.  High means low and low means high.  It is slightly confusing.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thyroid issues, in general, are not always black and white.  It is not as simple as you are hypothyroid or your not.  It is a bit more complicated, especially if someone has positive thyroid auto-antibodies, which we will cover in the next episode.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The lab numbers are certainly important, but so is the patient.  One rule we always follow is to treat the patient, not the lab test. The TSH is not the only part of the thyroid function and should be tested along with a Free T4 and the Free T3.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The TSH comes from the brain to signal the thyroid gland to produce or not produce thyroid hormone.  If the thyroid gland is underproducing thyroid hormone, then the TSH increases.  If the thyroid gland is overproducing, then the TSH decreases.  In physiology, this is referred to as a feedback loop.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, imagine asking your daughter to pick up her shoes and put them away. If she puts her shoes away, great, you only had to ask once in a  normal-tone  of voice.  But what if she ignores you or doesn t hear you? You would raise your voice until she puts her shoes away.  The TSH does the same thing with an underactive thyroid.  The TSH level increases if the thyroid gland is underproducing hormone.  </span></p>
<h4><strong>TSH Reference Range:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">0.45 &#8211; 4.5 mIU/L</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This reference range is huge, and a lot of people fall into a &#8216;normal&#8217; TSH level.  We have been trained that if the TSH level is 2.0 mIu.mL or higher, that person may have low thyroid function.  Even the American Association Of Clinical Endocrinologists claim that the TSH levels should be .34 to 2.5 mIu.mL.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The TSH is not the only part of thyroid function.  The Free T4 and Free T3 should also be done in order thoroughly evaluate the thyroid function. Keep reading, so I can explain what the Free T4 and Free T3 are.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Free T4 (FT4)</strong></h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thyroxine, which is abbreviated (T4) is the primary hormone that is produced by the thyroid gland.  The number 4 is related to the number iodine molecules that are needed to make the hormone.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thyroxine is very stable and has a long half-life of close to 7 days, but is an inactive hormone and does not have much impact directly on overall body function.  Your body converts T4 into T3, which is the most active form of thyroid hormone.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For testing purposes, there is a Total T4 and Total T3 test, which is the respective hormone bound to a carrier protein.  Most hormones in the body are transported in the blood via carrier proteins.  With our patients, we prefer just to run the &#8216;Free,&#8221; unbound T4 and T3.  </span></p>
<h4><strong>Free T4 Reference Range:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Free T4 0.8 &#8211; 1.8ng/dL</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Free T3 (FT3)</strong></h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Triiodothyronine (T3) is the active form of thyroid hormone.  You can have all the T4 in the world, but without T3 you would still have hypothyroid symptoms.   </span></p>
<h4>Free T3 Reference Range:</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Free T3 2.0 &#8211; 4.4 pg/dL</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This reference range for free T3 is also huge.   Truly, any patient we see with a T3 under 3.0 ng/dL is usually tired, has a slow metabolism, is constipated, has a low mood, has dry skin, and is losing hair.  It is best to have a Free T3 level at least above 3.0 ng/dL. A level is between 3.8-4.4ng/dL is optimal for thyroid function.</span></p>
<h4><strong>A Simple Banking Analogy: </strong></h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I consider the T4 like your savings account and the T3 your checking account.  We all know it is good to have a nice cushy savings account. However, we also need that checking account, so we can pay bills and buy the things we need to live.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is the same thing with thyroid hormones; we need an optimal level of T4 (saving and transfer to checking).  And we need an optimal amount of T3 to utilize all the great functions thyroid provides for us.  The easier and more efficient the transfer is from your savings (T4) to your checking (T3) the better your thyroid will function and the better you will feel.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Approximately 60% of this T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the liver.  About another 20% occurs due to the bacteria (microbiome) in your colon.  The last approximate 20% is converted by body tissues such as your muscles.  </span></p>
<h4><strong>Reverse T3 (RT3)</strong></h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reverse T3 is an inert, inactive thyroid hormone.  We usually only test this in patients currently taking Synthroid, Levoxyl or Levothyroxine.  All of these medications as a class are referred to as T4 monotherapy.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These medicines only contain T4, and the body needs to convert the T4 into T3 by removing an iodine molecule.  If the dosage of the medication is too high, then the body shifts to converting T4 into Reverse T3, which competes with T3.    </span></p>
<h4><strong>Reverse T3 Reference Range:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">8-25 ng/dL</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Optimal Level: RT3 less than &lt;20 ng/dL</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also in Hashimoto s or a starvation/caloric restriction diet, the Free T4 will not convert to Free T3 and instead to RT3.  More Reverse T3 and less Free T3 will cause the person to have more hypothyroid symptoms.  We will dive into both Hashimotos and caloric restriction on future episodes.  </span></p>

4549,814,How Do I Know If I Have Hashimoto Thyroiditis? | PYHP 020,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode020-HashimotoThyroiditis.mp3?podcast_id=3886,1724,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>Hashimoto Thyroiditis is an autoimmune process where your immune system will attack your thyroid gland. This attack will eventually cause the thyroid function to drop. Inevitably, Hashimoto s disease causes hypothyroid.<br />
There are two primary blood antibodies to test for Hashimoto s disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPO)</li>
<li>Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have one or both of these antibodies, then you would be positive for Hashimoto s disease.</p>
<p>Some people have these antibodies and do not have any hypothyroid issues or changes to their TSH, Free T4, and Free T3. If you catch the presence of the antibodies early enough, you can prevent the onset of Hashimoto s or the severity of it through supplementation, diet, and lifestyle. As stated above, Hashimoto s is an autoimmune condition, leading to hypothyroid. Several factors can cause, exacerbate or reduce the onset of Hashimoto s thyroiditis. Females are more likely to have Hashimoto s disease Hashimoto s and it runs in families.</p>
<p>High levels of chronic stress can cause a rise in cortisol. Chronic elevations of cortisol can alter immune function.<br />
Ingesting a highly processed, refined carbohydrate diet can cause higher levels of insulin and cortisol which again, can alter immune function. Many people have gluten intolerance, and that can exacerbate the onset and severity of Hashimoto s.</p>
<p>A thyroid ultrasound is a non-invasive way of imaging the thyroid. People with Hashimoto s can have enlarged thyroids, multiple nodules or cysts on the thyroid. But many people without thyroid disease or Hashimoto s can have nodules and thyroid anomalies. So an ultrasound is not a definitive way of finding out if you have Hashimoto s.</p>
<p>If you are wondering if you have Hashimoto s thyroiditis, have your blood tested for the presence of Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPO) and Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb).</p>
<p>The presence of Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies is the most common in Hashimoto s Disease. About 70-80% of people with Hashimoto s with have the TPO antibodies present. Most doctors only test the Anti-TPO in patients, but it is important to also check for the Thyroglobulin Antibodies so that they are not missing patients with Hashimoto s Disease.<br />
In about 15-20% of patients with Hashimoto s disease, the Thyroglobulin antibodies only are present. The presence of TPO and TG antibodies together is much less common at about 5%.</p>
<h4>Reference Ranges:</h4>
<p>TPO &lt;9 iu/mL<br />
TGab &lt;1 iu/mL</p>
<p>Monitoring the presence and the levels of Hashimoto s Antibodies is essential in treatment. While Hashimoto s does lead to hypothyroidism, It is important not to just focus on the hypothyroid aspect of Hashimoto s disease. While keeping the thyroid function levels in optimal range is a good start in Hashimoto s. It is also key to work on the adrenals, hormones and immune system. Monitoring the levels of TPO and TgAb can help in evaluating treatment with a patient that has Hashimoto s.</p>
<p>If you are unsure if you have Hashimoto s disease, the best way to find out is to do a blood test. Testing for Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) and Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb) will show you if you have or have the potential for Hashimoto s thyroiditis. Hashimoto s Disease not only can cause hypothyroid, but it can also cause other conditions in the body.</p>
<h4><strong>Hashimoto s can cause or exacerbate:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Inflammation</li>
<li>Joint pain</li>
<li>High cholesterol</li>
<li>Anemia/low iron</li>
<li>Weight gain</li>
<li>Brain fog/forgetful/unfocused</li>
<li>More susceptible to viruses</li>
<li>Dry skin</li>
<li>Hair loss</li>
<li>Mood issues</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Heart Palpitations</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances</li>
<li>Disruptions in menstrual cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have had the Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPO) and Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb) tested, and you have shown positive in one or both. It would be a good idea to get a more thorough blood test for the effects that Hashimoto s can have. These blood tests are:</p>
<p>Basic thyroid function and Hashimoto s testing: TSH, FreeT4, FreeT3, Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody and Thyroglobulin Antibody.</p>
<h4>Additional Lab Tests</h4>
<ul>
<li>CBC</li>
<li>CMP</li>
<li>Lipid panel</li>
<li>Insulin, fasting</li>
<li>Ferritin</li>
<li>CRP-hs</li>
<li>Sed Rate</li>
<li>TSI: thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin to rule out Grave s Disease</li>
<li>DHEA-Sulfate</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other tests that can also be done such as Epstein Barr Virus, other autoimmune and genetic testing. I like to start here so that we can set up a treatment plan to get the patient feeling better. The patient needs to feel better before they can explore exercise, eat better, or work on lifestyle measures. Once a patient is feeling better then we can move on from there in treatment and other causes for Hashimoto s Disease.</p>

<BR><BR><b>Overview:</b> Liberals were pro-eugenics in the 1920s, and they are pro-Planned Parenthood in the 2010s. Any surprise, anybody-  Christians like Calvin Coolidge opposed the liberal agenda of eugenics and racism in the 1920s, while liberals like Woodrow Wilson embraced inter-racial marriages and pushed for segregation in federal departments.   Christians still oppose the journalists that push for race-baiting and the trading in baby body parts and other evils. This program looks at the hypocrisy of the media and the tendency to excuse liberal icons despite their horrible lifestyles and policies.----This program includes- ----1.

It is called -reverse missions.- One South Korean missions group has seen 300 Korean missionaries in the UK over the last eight years.  They-re not reaching the whites, however.  They are reaching the internationals in the mission fields in London and New York.  We compare Iran and England, in this discussion with Pooyan Merhshahi, a pastor in George Whitfield-s home town of Cheltenham, northwest of London. ----This program includes- ----1.

<BR><BR><b>Overview:</b> Alabama, the last conservative bastion in the nation, finally bites the dust as the state prefers a liberal pro-pan sexual, pro-abort over a conservative pro-life, pro-family candidate. Doug Jones, as the leading voice in favor of sexual perversion and sexual abuse in the form of homosexuality wins the race. But, Alabama has deeper problems than this. Porn-Hub rates Alabama as the second most active pornography state in the country. We point out the rising hypocrisy of the media, as television shows increasingly sexualize younger and younger girls for their viewing audiences. We also interact with the mass of media scandals that have taken down political and media leaders. These are all instances of God's real and present judgment upon the nation. . .but as we point out here. . . judgment always begins in the house of God.----This program includes-----1.

<BR><BR><b>Overview:</b> CaliforniaDs Governor Jerry Brown takes on a prophetic role, as he calls President Trump to the fear of the Lord, or a fear of the wrath of God. This liberal governor links the wrath of God to the fires in California.  Indeed, GodDs judgment has visited this nation this year.  This year brought record hurricane damages and record fire damages D in the same year.  Almost 10,000,000 acres have burned down, causing around -180 billion in damages.  We contrast three explanations for the fires.   The typical academic-media explanation that points to a chance universe, Jerry BrownDs explanation, and the BibleDs explanation for these natural disasters. ----This program includes- ----1.

4644,814,Which Thyroid Medication is Best? | PYHP 021,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode021-WhichThyroidMedicationisBest.mp3?podcast_id=3915,1594,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>Which thyroid medication is best?  This is a question we get from patients quite often.  Conventionally for hypothyroidism, there is one medication prescribed. Regardless of your gender, family/personal history, symptoms, goals. If you need thyroid replacement, you will get Synthroid.</p>
<p>If you have had your thyroid gland radiated, now it is hypothyroid. If you have had thyroid cancer and your thyroid has been removed. If you have Hashimoto&#8217;s disease, or you have a sluggish underactive thyroid. In this day and age, there is only one medication you will be given.</p>
<p>Yes, that is Synthroid. Synthroid is T4 monotherapy. Meaning&#8211;it is a form of levothyroxine. As mentioned in other blogs, T4/levothyroxine is a stable molecule, which is supposed to convert to the active thyroid molecule, T3. There are so many other ways and medications to treat an under-functioning thyroid, so here is a synopsis of thyroid medications.</p>
<h4>T4 Monotherapy</h4>
<p>As I said, there is T4 Monotherapy, also known as levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is also known as Synthroid. Also included in T4 monotherapy is Levoxyl and Tirosint.</p>
<ul>
<li>Synthroid</li>
<li>Levoxyl</li>
<li>Levothyroxine</li>
<li>Tirosint</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember T4 is supposed to convert to T3 which is the active form of thyroid. Often T4 will not efficiently convert to T3. It is common to hear patients say that even on Synthroid or raising their dose, they still feel  hypothyroid.  Also, higher doses of T4 monotherapy can convert to Reverse-T3 instead of T3. Reverse-T3 (RT3) is an inert molecule that has no activity.</p>
<h4>Conventional T3 therapy</h4>
<p>Conventional T3 therapy is not commonly prescribed. The only option for T3 treatment conventionally is to use the commercially available prescription is Cytomel, which is a very unstable medication because it is instant release upon ingesting.</p>
<p>Taking too high a dose of Cytomel can put pressure on the heart and cause heart palpitations and even a risk to the cardiovascular system. You must be careful with Cytomel dosing because of the risk to the heart. Most docs only prescribe 5 mcg or at the most 10mcg.</p>
<h4>Desiccated Thyroid Medications</h4>
<p>Desiccated thyroid medication is made from a porcine source. It is pig thyroid gland desiccated (dried) to make thyroid replacement medication. This type of medicine is considered a natural form of thyroid medication.</p>
<p>The good thing about porcine thyroid is that it has T4 and T3 in the same medication. So a patient can get the T4 and the active form of thyroid, T3 at the same time. There are a few name brands to the porcine thyroid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Armour</li>
<li>Nature Throid</li>
<li>West Throid</li>
<li>WP Thyroid</li>
</ul>
<p>Nature Throid and West Throid are identical medications and are made by the same company, RLC Labs. WP Thyroid is also made by RLC Labs but is made with different fillers such as coconut oil and inulin. Patients that are sensitive to fillers can do better on WP Thyroid, and it can also be chewed up as well as swallowed.</p>
<p>There is also compounded porcine thyroid available from a compounding pharmacy. This is useful if a patient is sensitive to fillers in the commercially available brands of desiccated thyroid. Recently with the backorder of Nature Throid and the rising cost of Armour, compounded thyroid is another option.</p>
<p>One drawback of desiccated thyroid medication is the doses all come in a 4:1 ratio of T4 to T3. So 65mg of Nature Throid is equal to 38mcg of T4 and 9mcg of T3. Some patients cannot tolerate the T3 and need lower T3 levels, and some patients need more. So with desiccated thyroid, the T4/T3 ratio cannot be individually tailored to the patients. Also, Desiccated thyroid medication is made from pigs, so it is obviously not a vegetarian option of thyroid medication.</p>
<h4>Compounded Thyroid (T4/T3 levothyroxine/liothyronine)</h4>
<p>The great thing about compounded T4/T3 it is available in any microgram dosing of levothyroxine/liothyronine.  The dosage of each hormone can be adjusted independently of the other.</p>
<ul>
<li>T4 = Levothyroxine</li>
<li>T3 = Liothyronine</li>
<li>Instant release</li>
<li>Sustained release</li>
</ul>
<p>In most situations, we prefer to prescribe compounded thyroid because of the dosing flexibility for us and the patient.  Compounded porcine and Desiccated thyroid are also great options.  We typically do not prescribe any of the T4 Monotherapy medications or Cytomel very often if at all.</p>

<BR><BR><b>Overview:</b> -With the multitudinous scandals coming out of Christian ministries, it seems appropriate that we learn how to deal properly with them. We refer to the child molestations allegations and investigations of child molestations that surrounded Voice of the Martyrs from 2012 to the present.  These things ride like a cloud on these ministries, but how does one resolve it-  Now, a cloud has descended upon Ravi Zacharias-s ministry as well.  Kevin Swanson recommends independent investigations, and accountability with church eldership.----This program includes-----1. Generations with Kevin Swanson----2.

4696,814,How Much Do Blood Tests Cost? | PYHP 022,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode022-HowMuchDoBloodTestsCost-edited.mp3?podcast_id=3935,1642,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>With all of the recent changes in health insurance, blood testing is more expensive than ever.  Below are few questions and situations we get from our patients and thought it would be good to discuss.  Do any of the following sound familiar?</p>
<h3>My Doctor Won&#8217;t Order Thyroid Function Test, What Should I Do?</h3>
<p>We see this often. Patients complain that they have been to many doctors, internists, endocrinologists and all that gets tested is a TSH for thyroid function. With the internet and dissatisfaction in healthcare, people are becoming their own health advocates. People are researching and keeping a keen eye on their health. People know that they want more than a TSH test for thyroid function. But they run into a  wall  with their conventional doctor. Their primary care, internist, or endocrinologist will not run a free T4 or a free T3.</p>
<h3>I Want to Find Out if my Friends and Family have a Thyroid Problem:</h3>
<p>Often thyroid conditions like Hashimoto&#8217;s Disease can run in the family. I have a patient that swear their sister, mother or brother have a thyroid problem too. But either the family member is reluctant to approach their doctor about it. Or their doctor will not order the thyroid functional testing or Hashimoto s antibodies. Read on so I can show you how to find out if your family member has a thyroid issue.</p>
<h3>I Don&#8217;t Have Insurance and Want to Order Blood Work:</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, health insurance can be costly. My monthly health insurance premiums cost more than my first car. Granted, my first car was not very nice, but I had a whole lot more fun with it than my health insurance. People know they need to get regular screenings, annual and routine blood work done; however, some are terrified that without insurance it will cost a fortune. Honestly, blood work out of pocket can be pretty much the equivalent of a mortgage payment. But read on, I have some tips to help you get blood work without having to promise your first born.</p>
<h3>My Deductible is Enormous! Blood Work Will Cost Me a Fortune!</h3>
<p>My deductible is $5000+. I hope that I never meet that 5000$ deductible because if I do, that means something unfortunate happened to me. I might get negotiated rates for blood work, but I will still have to pay out of pocket for my blood work.  This could be quite costly.</p>
<h3>I Don&#8217;t Want to Wait Two Months for an Appointment just to have Blood Work Ordered!</h3>
<p>Time is money. Time is not a renewable resource, meaning it is going to run out someday. And I don t want to waste my precious time waiting in a waiting room full of sick people so I can see the doctor. The doctor will then spend 3 minutes with me and give me an order for blood work. Then I have to come back to go over those results. Let s save some time and avoid all that nonsense. Read on to find out how.</p>
<h3>I got a Huge Bill for Blood Work, but I have Insurance!</h3>
<p>I have heard this a lot recently, which is what prompted me to write this. I have patients that have insurance and still have to pay over a $1000 to pay for their blood work. Whether it is a high deductible or limited coverage, they end up with a bill several weeks later that can be well over a 1000$. I know it seems silly that you are paying for healthcare coverage and you get a large &#8216;out of pocket&#8217; bill for blood work. This a pretty common theme in the last few years.</p>
<h3>What can you do? Order the test yourself!</h3>
<p>We all know you cannot walk into a lab like Quest or LabCorp without a requisition from a doctor. And everyone is under the assumption that if insurance is not paying for the test, then it is too expensive. Yes, paying Quest and LabCorp out of pocket directly for lab testing is very expensive, sometimes over 1000$.</p>
<p>We have physician-only accounts with Quest and LabCorp to get you reasonable out of pocket pricing. Recently, I have had three patients tell me that they were billed over a 1000$ for their blood work because of deductibles and limited insurance coverage. That is ridiculous because out of pocket those tests would have only cost them about $150 to $300 at the most! So if you want a specific lab test just let me know what tests you want, and I will put them together for you with pricing.</p>
<p>I have been getting a lot of patients that want to test their family member s thyroid function lately. Recently I had a patient with Hashimoto s hypothyroid tell me that she  knows  her sister has a thyroid problem, but her sister will not go to the doctor to get tested for Hashimoto s or even for hypothyroid.</p>
<p>I felt terrible because I can t legally order a test through their insurance without establishing them as a patient. We talked about how we can get her sister a test so she can  see  the data on paper and realize that she too has a thyroid issue. However, we can order the tests cash-pay without establishing them as a patient. They just buy the test, get it done and get the results emailed to them. It turned out, my patient purchased the test for her sister.</p>
<p>Just go to our <a href=""https://shop.progressyourhealth.com/collections/lab-testing"" xlink=""href"">online store </a>to check out our lab panels and pricing. Like I said if there are tests you do not see that you like. Just email us, and we will get the test ordered for you.</p>
<p>As an end of the year special, we have put together a thyroid-function panel discounted. Click here and buy it for someone and they have six months to get the test done.</p>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you have tampons everywhere. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In every single purse, the glove box of your car. In t</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">he glove box of your friend s and spouse s car. In the kitchen drawers, all bathrooms, in your jacket pockets, even your grocery bags.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You never wear white.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You don t own white underwear because at some point they will no longer be white.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You know exactly when and how much ibuprofen you can take.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You have a whole bunch of the light tampons because you never use them from the box.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You laugh at the purple Tampax lites.  Because seriously, what magical woman actually uses them? And we hate her.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You time everything around your period. How long can I stay in the meeting? How long is that exercise class? How long is that road trip and what are the stops on the way?</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You always get your period right before or during vacation. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You devote an entire bathroom cabinet to super-heavy-plus tampons and those huge, bulky overnight pads.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have heavy periods, aka menorrhagia, then you know quite literally what a pain it can be.  From the pain of cramping to always knowing where is the closest bathroom.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the most part, heavy periods are benign, just bothersome. (But if you have heavy periods make sure to discuss with your doctor so that you do not become anemic and test for underlying diseases/disorders.) </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">B</span>ut what causes heavy periods?  Below are some of the more common reasons women may develop heavy periods.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><strong>Estrogen-Progesterone Imbalance:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having an elevated level of estrogen or lower progesterone can cause heavy periods.  Estrogen is the best hormone in the world. Estrogens keeps your skin youthful and hydrated.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your own estrogen is good for your heart, bones, brain, hair, sleep, and libido to name a few.  But she can be a runaway train if not balanced.  Estrogen likes to  grow-things.   Estrogen grows our breast tissues and uterine lining. If there is an imbalance of lower progesterone to estrogen, she will grow the uterine lining so thick that you practically hemorrhage once a month.  It is important to have your hormones checked and balanced if you have heavy periods.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><strong>Low thyroid function:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hypothyroid can also contribute to heavy periods.  The thyroid also helps to rein in estrogen s negative effects. If your thyroid is low, the estrogen will grow that uterine lining very thick.  So that you will have heavy periods and also commonly spot through the cycle.  It will also cause the period to last for what seems like FOREVER. If you have heavy periods, mid-cycle spotting, long periods, talk to your doctor about testing your thyroid.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><strong>Uterine Fibroids/Polyps/Cysts:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember how estrogen likes to  grow things.   So if your estrogen/progesterone balance is off that can cause fibroids, cysts, and polyps to grow.  Also, genetics can also be a curse of growing fibroids, cysts and polyps.  But these growths can cause very heavy periods usually with lots of cramping.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><strong>Endometriosis:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Endometriosis is uterine tissue growing outside of the uterus.  There are many reasons, theories on what causes endometriosis. That is an entirely separate blog.  But endometriosis is common for causing heavy, painful periods, and cysts.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Medications:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Medications can also cause heavy periods.  While birth control pills are supposed to help with heavy bleeding, some women can have heavy periods.   Some women react with heavy periods being on birth control pills.  Blood-thinning medications can cause heavy bleeding with periods. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><strong>Intrauterine Device:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">IUDs (used for birth control) can cause heavy periods.  In particular, the non-hormonal IUDs can cause heavy, long periods and midcycle spotting.  Typically, the hormonal IUDs do not cause heavy periods.  However, in some women, hormonal IUDs can cause a reaction of heavy periods.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Blood-thinning diseases:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While not common, blood thinning conditions can cause heavy periods.  Platelet disorders, hemophilia, and Von Willebrand disease will cause heavy bleeding.  Usually, there are many other symptoms associated with blood thinning diseases. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br />
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heavy periods are categorized as a loss of 60 ml or greater than 3tablespoons of blood per period.  But you don t need to measure how much blood lost to know you have heavy periods. If you have heavy periods, trust me, you know it.  The most common conventional treatments are birth control pills, ablation or hysterectomy.  Before you resort to conventional treatment, know there are non-invasive alternatives.  </span></p>

His articles have appeared in a variety of publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. Our ability to learn is one of the most important skills that we can develop in life. We are constantly learning, and our success in life is often dependent on how well we are able to do it. However, it turns out that we are surrounded by false beliefs and teachings about what it means to learn and how to learn most effectively. Ulrich Boser, whose new book, Learn Better, maps out the science of learning, destroying a number of myths along the way.

4748,814,Do I Have Estrogen Dominance?  | PYHP 024,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode024-SymptomsofEstrogenDominance.mp3?podcast_id=3946,1816,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>As I have always stated before, us ladies are a symphony of hormones. If one hormone is out of tune, it is quite apparent. However, sometimes it is hard to hear what instrument (hormone) is out of tune because when one hormone is out of balance, others seem to follow suit. So remember, it is not a good idea to fixate on one hormone being out of balance. It s about balancing them as a whole.</p>
<p>Patients tell me all the time,  they have estrogen dominance.  They read on the internet, and their symptoms fit  estrogen dominance.  Yes, their symptoms do fit estrogen-dominance, but It does not mean their estrogen is the only hormone that is  off. </p>
<p>I am going to go through some common  estrogen dominance symptoms  that you might find on the internet. And I will explain what other hormones might be at work here besides estrogen. Later in another episode, I will delve into more detail, causation, and treatment to balance our hormones.</p>
<h3>PMS:</h3>
<p>&#8220;My PMS is off the chain 7-10 days before my period! . This is actually because the progesterone is too low compared to the estrogen level. It is not that estrogen is  too-high,  but because the progesterone failed to peak after ovulation or it dived too quickly before your period.</p>
<h3>Fibrocystic breast tissue:</h3>
<p>If your estrogen is high, it can cause dense breast tissue and fibrocystic breasts. Estrogen likes to  grow things.  So if estrogen is not balanced or is high, the breast tissue will thicken and can become fibrocystic. Also, caffeine can exacerbate or lead to fibrocystic breast tissue.</p>
<p>This is because the progesterone level is to low for the amount of estrogen. Your estrogen levels might be &#8220;normal,&#8221; but because the progesterone is lacking it cannot hold back the estrogen. So estrogen will continue to grow that uterine lining.</p>
<h3>Headaches:</h3>
<p>This again is because the progesterone is too low for the amount of estrogen. A drop in progesterone can cause hormonal headaches starting at 14 days before your period. If you have headaches the last half of your cycle, your progesterone might be too low.</p>
<h3>Breast swelling and tenderness:</h3>
<p>Estrogen can cause water weight. Our breast tissue is very sensitive to estrogen. So if your estrogen is high, it can cause water retention in the breast tissue, making them feel full, heavy and, tender.</p>
<h3>Weight gain in the belly:</h3>
<p>Female hormones can contribute to weight gain, but not by themselves. It happens via the connection that estrogen/progesterone has with insulin and cortisol. High levels of cortisol and insulin will cause fat to accumulate around the mid-section. When the progesterone is low, or estrogen is high, that can cause insulin and cortisol to elevate. This will make you gain weight and also make it hard to lose.</p>
<h3>Mood swings:</h3>
<p>Feeling grumpy, snarky, irritable, weep, or sad. When the progesterone to estrogen balance is off, it can definitely affect our moods. If progesterone is low, that causes irritability. When you feel like everything it aggravating and you are quick to anger. That is low progesterone. If you feel weepy and nostalgic, that is high estrogen.</p>
<h3>Decreased sex drive:</h3>
<p>I think this is because the progesterone is too low and it makes us irritable. And us ladies do not want to have sex if we are angry or aggravated. High levels of estrogen do not drop the sex drive. Low levels of estrogen drop the sex drive. That is why sex flies out the window when we enter perimenopause or menopause.</p>
<h3>Fibroids/polyps/exacerbated endometriosis:</h3>
<p>Again, estrogen likes to  grow stuff.  If estrogen is high, it can also grow fibroids and polyps. It does seem to aggravate endometriosis.</p>
<h3>Cold hands/feet, hair loss, foggy thinking, memory loss:</h3>
<p>If you have any of these symptoms, then we want to look at your thyroid. Thyroid comes into play with estrogen and progesterone balance. If thyroid levels are low, that can cause progesterone to drop. This drop in progesterone will cause estrogen to become dominant. So low thyroid level can be the culprit of your estrogen-dominance symptoms/low progesterone symptoms. Also, I need to mention adrenal dysfunction.</p>
<p>These symptoms can be caused adrenal dysfunction. When your adrenal function is compromised, it can lead to a drop in progesterone, a rise in insulin and inappropriate cortisol secretion. That in it of itself can create an estrogen/progesterone imbalance.<br />
Even symptoms of brain-fog, memory loss, and fatigue are related your adrenals, not just female hormones. Low memory can also be a symptom of low estrogen. So if you have any of these symptoms the thyroid and the adrenals are most likely your culprit.</p>
<h3>Trouble sleeping:</h3>
<p>This should be categorized as either trouble falling asleep or trouble staying asleep. Trouble falling asleep is usually from adrenal dysfunction. The cortisol is too high at night, and you cannot fall asleep.</p>
<p>Trouble staying asleep is from low progesterone. The low progesterone will cause you to wake in the middle of the night. Then your cortisol rises, so forget getting good sleep after that.</p>
<h3>Bloating:</h3>
<p>Estrogen retains water. So if your estrogen is high, it can cause water retention everywhere. From your stomach to your ankles, your face, your hands. Low progesterone can cause bloating. But low progesterone will cause the bloating more in your bowels and stomach.</p>

4768,814,Who is a Candidate for BHRT? | PYHP 025,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode025-whoisacandidateforBHRT.mp3?podcast_id=3951,1314,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>Traditionally when one thinks of Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT), they immediately think of menopause. That hormone therapy is used to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. But in the last 10-15 years, hormone replacement has become more than a fix for hot flashes. But did you know that you can use BHRT for memory, energy and even libido? Did you know that men and women of all ages use BHRT? There are many other conditions that BHRT can treat. Below are a few conditions that BHRT can address that you may not know about.</p>
<h3>Hypothyroid:</h3>
<p>When people think of hypothyroid medication, you may think of Synthroid or the porcine thyroid (Armour/Nature Throid). However, Compounded Thyroid, which is a combination of Levothyroxine and Liothyronine, is an excellent option to treat hypothyroid.</p>
<h3>PMS:</h3>
<p>Using bioidentical progesterone helps to alleviate some of the symptoms related to PMS. You can use progesterone in many different dosage forms depending on the situation. From creams to capsules, to troches to vaginal suppositories. You can use bioidentical progesterone all month long or just part of the month or even a few days of a woman s cycle for PMS symptoms.</p>
<h3>PCOS:</h3>
<p>The conventional approach to PCOS is to prescribe birth control pills. However, this is such a limited treatment approach, and there are some potential side effects associated with birth control. But with BHRT you can individualize the doses of BHRT to the patient. This can help with PCOS symptoms but also help with the long-term effects of PCOS on the body such as the androgenic effects and fertility.</p>
<h3>Perimenopause:</h3>
<p>My patients in perimenopause describe it as feeling like they have PMS symptoms all month long. Plus, it is not healthy to use birth control pills in a perimenopausal female. Bioidentical hormones can be used effectively and safely to help women with perimenopausal symptoms. The symptoms range from irritability to trouble sleeping. From low libido to hair loss and acne. Bioidentical hormones can even help with perimenopausal weight gain.</p>
<h3>Low Testosterone aka  Low T :</h3>
<p>Men can use Bioidentical Testosterone to address Low T. Conventionally low testosterone is treated with injections and gels, which can be expensive and cause some unwanted side effects. Besides, conventional testosterone cannot be tailored to the patient. Whether it is personal symptoms or family health history, hormone replacement therapy needs to meet the needs of the patient. Conventional this can be difficult to do. But with BHRT you can design the testosterone to the patient.</p>
<h3>Adrenal Dysfunctions/Adrenal Fatigue/ Adrenal Insufficiency:</h3>
<p>There is more to Bioidentical Hormone options besides just the reproductive hormones. You can use BHRT to treat Adrenal Fatigue. BHRT for adrenal fatigue can include pregnenolone, DHEA, and hydrocortisone. These hormones can also come in creams, sublingual, capsules, and tablets.</p>
<h3>Menopause:</h3>
<p>This is what everyone thinks of when they hear Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT). The great aspect of BHRT is you can make any dose you want depending on the particular patient s symptoms. For women in menopause, there are many different symptoms and goals for each person.</p>
<p>For some women, their goals are to reduce hot flashes and night sweats. Other goals for women in menopause are low libido, vaginal dryness, and pain with intercourse. Others, it s dry skin and tonicity. Other women help with preserving bone density. With BHRT you can custom design the doses for the goals of the person.</p>
<p>As you can see Bioidentical Hormones Replacement Therapy can be helpful for more than just menopause. BHRT can be prescribed for men and women of all ages. There are exceptions to who is and is not a candidate for BHRT, but that is another episode in itself.</p>
<p>Developing a specific and personalized hormone treatment plan for each patient s takes the right knowledge and experience. It is essential for the physician to take the personal and family health history to determine if one is a good candidate for BHRT.<br />
If you are considering BHRT make sure you see an experienced physician that specializes in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, which is just as much of an art as it is a science.</p>

4778,814,How Much Do Bioidentical Hormones Cost? | PYHP 026,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode026-BioidenticalHormoneCost.mp3?podcast_id=3962,1090,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>Two common questions we get all the time is: how much does BHRT cost? And will my insurance cover it?</p>
<p>If I had a dollar for every time, I have been asked this question I might have a pair of those fancy Christian Louboutin heels. It&#8217;s okay because I can t stand heels anyway, but the cost of Bioidentical Hormones is undoubtedly a significant concern.</p>
<p>People have budgets, so they need to know if their BHRT is going to cost them a car payment, nothing or something in between. Considering BHRT can be an ongoing monthly prescription, these are valid questions.</p>
<p>I have been prescribing BHRT since 2004. In that time, the cost of BHRT and insurance coverage has changed a lot. Since BHRT has increased in popularity, some compounding pharmacies have started charging more and more.</p>
<p>Injectable growth hormone is a perfect example. Per month growth hormone has gone from the price of a fancy dinner to more than a round-trip airline ticket to Hawaii. Also, we are well aware of the breakdown and many changes to our healthcare system. This change made what used to be almost 100% coverage of BHRT to pretty much 0%.</p>
<p>I work with a few compounding pharmacies, and I am very particular which pharmacies those are. Price is an essential factor, but quality and safety is the main priority. BHRT is not a supplement or vitamin. BHRT are prescription medications. That means you do not want to take something that you might be questioning quality over price.<br />
Compounded thyroid medication is a good example. If the T3 (Liothyronine) dosage is altered by the smallest of micrograms, a patient can end up in the emergency room with a heart arrhythmia.</p>
<p>So what are you going to pay for BHRT? Unfortunately, this is a loaded question without a definite answer. It depends on how many BHRT prescriptions you are taking. As well as what dosage and the type you need for your specific health goals.<br />
To be incredibly broad (sorry) each prescription is going to cost between $30 to $70. With the average cost of a prescription being right around $50.</p>
<p>Sorry to break this to you, but insurance is most likely not going to cover any of it. Some insurances might cover a portion of the prescription, but usually not the full cost.</p>
<p>Conventional hormone replacement can be covered by insurance, but these hormones cannot be tailored to the individual and have some unwanted side effects. This is why patients do well on custom BHRT, but unfortunately, there is going to be an out of pocket pricing. I understand this episode may seem vague and might leave you frustrated. But honestly, this is the best I can tell you. And I am sure the cost and insurance coverage will continue to change.</p>

4848,814,How Do I Get Rid of Belly Fat? | PYHP 027,http://progressyourhealth.com/PYHPEpisode027-BellyFat.mp3?podcast_id=4016,1492,"<div class=""pf-content""><div class=""pbs-main-wrapper""><p>Getting rid of stubborn belly fat is one of the main complaints I hear from patients. In particular, the female patients. More specifically, the female patients over 40 years old. Why is it you can eat a cheeseburger, fries and shake when you are 20, but forget it at 40?</p>
<p>Why does it seem that the waistline keeps growing regardless of exercise and diet?</p>
<p>This is where it becomes an issue of balancing metabolic hormones rather than eating less or exercising more.  Our metabolic hormone balance at 20 is vastly different from 40. I know it sounds like age, but it is more about metabolic hormones.<br />
Even in younger women, there can be a metabolic hormone  imbalance.  It isn t really about age, but more about the chronic stress altering our metabolic hormones causing one of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight distribution changes</li>
<li>Waistline enlarges, and legs get thinner</li>
<li>Belly fat, muffin top, and back fat</li>
<li>All of it: back fat, muffin top, spare tire and thin legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Chronic stress affects all of our hormones. Mainly causing insulin and cortisol to rise. The increase in insulin and cortisol will shift sugar/glucose storage toward fat storing rather than fat burning. What is chronic stress? And why is my insulin elevated because I am a stressed out hot mess?</p>
<p>What is the solution to get rid of belly fat?</p>
<p>If the goal is to get rid of belly fat, then you must reduce/balance insulin and cortisol.</p>
<p>The next million dollar question: how do I reduce insulin and cortisol? Because my stressed out hot-mess of a life isn t going away!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s keep it simple! We have a program called the Keto Carb Cycling Program (KCCP), which we designed to help you lose that stubborn belly fat. You can download the KCCP for free from our Content Library.  Then, all you have to do is follow it.  Of course, this is easy said than done, so be gentle with yourself and take the necessary time to allow it to work.</p>

<p><em>The House of Seven Santas</em> is actually a short story written in 1912 by John Kendrick Bangs. But it is presented to you by seven separate Christmas podcasters in an unprecedented collaboration to spread a little Christmas cheer. </p>
<p>The story has been divided in to seven parts &#8212; and we&#8217;ve got the exciting and heartwarming finish to the tale. </p>
<p>So, to begin, please visit the <a href=""http://www.christmaspastpodcast.com/""><strong>Christmas Past Podcast</strong></a> hosted by Brian Earl to hear Part 1 of the story. </p>
<p>Then jump to the <a href=""http://cantwaitforchristmaspod.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Can&#8217;t Wait for Christmas Podcast</strong></a> with Sir Tim Babb, to hear Part 2. </p>
<p>Part #3 belongs to the merry movie crew at <a href=""https://www.tisthepodcast.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Tis the Podcast</strong></a> &#8212; Anthony, Julia and Tom. </p>
<p>Joseph Wade of the podcast at <a href=""https://christmascreeps.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>ChristmasCreeps.com</strong></a> hosts Part #4 of the story. </p>
<p>For Part #5 we turn to Craig at <a href=""https://weirdchristmas.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>WeirdChristmas.com</strong></a></p>

<p>And you can hear Part #7 below. </p>
<p>We encourage you to listen to all episodes presented above and then come to My Merry Christmas to read the story for yourself. </p>
<p>The story is a classic in the sense that the vocabulary and terminology of the times in which it was written is quite evident. But in the end it is a heartwarming tale as most Christmas stories are &#8212; one you&#8217;ll be glad to read and to know. </p>

4945,241,The Christmas Hero in Jimmy Stewart,https://merrypodcast.com/podcast-download/128/christmas-hero-jimmy-stewart.mp3,1019,"<p>Even in his day Jimmy Stewart was uncommonly decent. This fact seemed to jump out of the screen despite the role he played. But it was in his private life &#8212; which he tried to keep very private &#8212; that Stewart shined the brightest. </p>
<p>No matter how famous he became, no matter what role he played, no matter the age he was in his life &#8212; Stewart was constant. He oozed authenticity and yet seemed rare in nearly all he did. </p>
<p>When it comes to Christmas &#8212; Jimmy Stewart was a hero. He didn&#8217;t know it, he didn&#8217;t plan it and it wasn&#8217;t part of something accidental. It just happened. It endures because in Jimmy Stewart, both on-screen and off, we see ourselves. </p>
<p>That is quite the praise for just an actor. But Jimmy Stewart was much more than just an actor. </p>
<p>In this merry episode we take a look at Jimmy Stewart&#8217;s two Christmas movies and how they were shaped by the man inside. </p>
<p>We explore where he was in his life as these films were made and how the influence of his life made the Christmas in those movies so lasting. </p>
<p>A hundred years from now will <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em> still be considered a classic? </p>
<p>We believe goodness endures.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what made Jimmy Stewart so great: simple goodness.  </p>",2017-12-08 04:55:28+00

&nbsp;<p>It was fantastic getting the opportunity to chat with podcaster and music enthusiast Ado Veli about the Kenyan music industry. It has seen its highs and its lows over the years. There is plenty of promise but doing music business in the Kenyan environment is quite a challenge. Ado Veli takes us on a journey where we discover the golden age of Kenyan popular music and how the industry has evolved since then. We also talk about piracy and where artists need to pull up their socks in order to make the most of their music.</p><p>Follow <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/ADOVELI?lang=en"">Ado Veli on Twitter</a></p>

<strong>                                The Last Last Jedi Review You Need</strong></aside>
<aside></aside>
<aside>Having decimated the Star Wars fan base with a never-ending barrage of twists, Rian Johnson has now been given the keys to a whole new trilogy.</aside>
<aside></aside>
<aside>Only the Idle Red Hands stand against the rising tyranny, certain that people will return to an era that fans will judge a movie by its quality, not its nostalgic callbacks.</aside>
<aside></aside>
<aside>But in a Johnsonian twist,  the Idle Red Hands don&#8217;t think Johnson is a childhood-raping SJW nor do they think he&#8217;s the icon-torching genius the Star Wars franchise needed. Instead, they engage in a thoughtful discussion (i.e., we don&#8217;t accuse each other of not being &#8220;real fans&#8221;) of what did and didn&#8217;t work in this latest installment of the Star Wars cinematic universe (cinematic galaxy?). As the episode ends, you will be closer to knowing whether or not you <em>need</em> more Star Wars movies&#8230;</aside>

Anthony Gonzalez & Gael Garcia Bernal</p> <p>Whoops I was so busy playing Batman: The Telltale Series I forgot to upload this last night, my mistake! I just bought it last week and I had to buy a 2 TB external hard drive so I actually could play the game.  When I bought my 500 GB Xbox One I figured that would be plenty of space and today it can hold a whole 7 games! So stupid Microsoft and, to an extent, Sony knew that we would need these external hard drives or ""upgrade"" and buy a newer system with more space. It's weak sauce. Anyways sorry for that small rant, this show is a little short this week, really bad news week, and as such it is shorter.

Kate tells us about the ways technology can help solve many of the problems facing the unbanked around the world.</p> <p>Some of the key takeaways from our conversation include:</p> <ul> <li>Lack of trust is a key barrier to getting the newly banked to use their new accounts.</li> <li>For fintech products to be successful, new users need to trust the financial institution, the product itself, and their own ability to use it.</li> <li>Socioeconomic status can play a huge role in how people use fintech. The differences between users within a country can be greater than similar groups across multiple countries.</li> <li>Necessity is the mother of innovation. Fintech in emerging markets has been forced to adapt to low profit margins and information constraints. These experiences could offer insights for firms aiming to fill gaps in financial inclusion in the United States.</li> </ul> <p><em>The views expressed are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or of the Federal Reserve System.</em></p>",2017-12-06 18:18:30+00

<p>The Doug Jones win in Alabama was great. It proved that with good organization and a bad opposing candidate we can eek out a win. The Progressive Revolution needs much more than that. It requires that we release the chains of indoctrination instituted directly by the tenets of the <a href=""https://egbertowillies.com/2013/12/26/powell-memo-business-powell-manifesto/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Powell Manifesto</strong></a> into the psyche of too many Americans along with the neutralization of evil politicians and Right Wing operatives stoking hate and fear.</p>

<p>About <em>Together and by Ourselves</em> and <em>Proprietary: Poems</em>:</p>
<p><em>Together and by Ourselves</em>, Alex Dimitrov&#8217;s second book of poems, takes on broad existential questions and the reality of our current moment: being seemingly connected to one another, yet emotionally alone. Through a collage aesthetic and a multiplicity of voices, these poems take us from coast to coast, New York to LA, and toward uneasy questions about intimacy, love, death, and the human spirit. Dimitrov critiques America&#8217;s long-lasting obsessions with money, celebrity, and escapism?whether in our personal, professional, or family lives. What defines a life? Is love ever enough? Who are we when together and who are we by ourselves? These questions echo throughout the poems, which resist easy answers. The voice is both heartfelt and skeptical, bruised yet playful, and always deeply introspective.</p>
<p>In <em>Proprietary</em>, Randall Mann critiques corporate culture, depicting (and slyly rebuking) the American materialism that erupted in the 1980s and has metastasized ever since. For years, Randall Mann has been hailed as one of contemporary American poetry&#8217;s most daring formalists, expertly using craft as a way of exploring racy subjects with trenchant wit and aplomb. His new collection, Proprietary, depicts with the insights of a longtime insider the culture of corporate America, in which he&#8217;s worked for years, intertwined with some of his tried-and-true subjects, including gay life in the wildly disparate worlds of San Francisco and northern Florida.</p>",2017-12-15 20:12:00+00

James has been off, which is weird considering schools broke up last week - Luckily, Alfie came forward as a (worryingly) willing replacement for early morning shots and general ""ball chat"". A big week for ""Plug My Panto"" too, with both Chris and Dom shocked by who's revealed, and it wouldn't be Christmas without Toby Tarrant discussing the most disturbing movie ever made, would it?    

There's other REALLY festive stuff too...  

- Chris buys a listener a very boring (but very practical) gift 
- Turns out Pippa isn't completely fluent in Spanish  
- Dom hurts his elbow 
- AND the lifts in this building are definitely ""fattist""
